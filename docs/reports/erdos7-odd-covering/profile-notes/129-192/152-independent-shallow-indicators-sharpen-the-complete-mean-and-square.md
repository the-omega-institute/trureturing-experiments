# Independent shallow indicators sharpen the complete mean and square

Keeping each shallow cylinder's own finite capacity bound and deletion
credit gives the following complete actual-source inequalities. Both
K orientations, every admissible first-beta distribution and independent
original test residues are included. In all rows rho<=1/100000 and
r<=1/520; sigma is at most the displayed radius.

| sigma radius | Complete H1 upper | Complete square Q upper |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
|1/10000|0.4926280696815065...|4.992209837666695...|
|1/50|0.5054431567866552...|5.094002198866021...|
|1/27|0.5164188222425470...|5.181021797971829...|

At zero source and residual radius the same formulas recover443/900
and374/75 exactly. Every original exponent tail remains. The square
uses its actual positive LCM categories, including the surviving unit
mass and the separate raw positive-seven contribution. These are
ordinary inequalities with exact rational certificates, not Lean
verification or a complete global comparison.

## 1. The finite face relaxation misses one actual identity

Use116's cells ROOT=(0,0,1,1,1), slots(P,A,B,Q,H), group masses
(1/36,1/12,5/36), first-beta cell L in{2,3,4}, and face density

    w*_(c,j)=1-t*_c/5-1_(j=H)/5-1_(c>=2,j=H)/5,
    t*=(0,1,1,1,1).                              (SI1)

There are47 independent shallow indicator layouts:2 for modulus3,
5 for9,5 for5,10 for15 and25 for45. For each, let phi be its0/1
cell-slot matrix and A_phi* its own additional mean reference from
section3 below. Exact three-group capacity optimization gives, for
each of the three possible L,

| Modulus | Generic maximum of integral w*phi-A_phi* | Adopted75 cap |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
|3|2/25|7/90|
|9|1/18|1/18|
|5|14/225|14/225|
|15|8/225|8/225|
|45|4/225|4/225|

The3 discrepancy is exactly1/450. A literal feasible relaxation
witness puts cell0 mass1/36 entirely outside H, and puts cell1's
non-H mass at its capacity11/180 and its H mass at1/45. Its root0
weighted value is9/100; the root0 mean reference is1/100. The
certificate supplies the complete25-entry witness and checks all
entry caps and all three group masses. Its root0 H mass is1/45,
which violates the actual face identity1/30. Thus it is a relaxation
counterexample, not an actual congruence-family counterexample.

For the actual source X,117 DP14 retains simultaneously

    H0=sum_(c<2)X_(c,H)=h0/5-(r-r1),
    H1=sum_(c>=2)X_(c,H)=h1/5-r1.                (SI2)

These are identities on one matrix. At the face H0=1/30,H1=1/15.
Consequently the two modulus3 finite values are79/900 and19/225;
subtracting their respective credits1/100 and1/150 gives7/90 in
both cases. The remaining four moduli retain the generic face LP.
No assertion that generic trimming alone recovers all five caps is
used in this result.

## 2. Keep source changes and residual cap changes separate

Fix0<=delta<=1/27 and0<=rho0<=1/100000. Use134's hmin,g,tbar,Cbar,
kbar at this rectangle, with rbar=5rho0. They have their original
positive packing guards. From134's source derivation, retain the
sharper root1 group bound before its exported simplification:

    d0=(5delta+delta^2)/72,
    d1=delta/36,
    dR=5delta/24-delta^2/72,
    N_G<=N_G*+dG.                               (SI3)

Let Ubar be the face cap table with these source-only increments:

| Entry | Increment over U* |
| --- | ---: |
|Exact excluded entry|0|
|Non-Q, cell0|delta/90|
|Non-Q, other cells|0|
|Q, cell0|delta/90+delta/24|
|Q, other cells|delta/12|

The actual cap is at most Ubar+r*a, where a vanishes off Q and its
Q entries are

    a=(1/9,2/9,1/(9hmin),1/(9hmin),1/(9hmin)).   (SI4)

These are the134 product bounds with r/h<=2r and r/h1<=r/hmin.
For cell0, use its eta increment times the full slot cap1/5 before
bounding the remaining face-eta term. This retains all delta*r
terms without adding an unjustified product approximation.

The actual carrier concentration gives t_c>=1-delta for c!=0 and
t0>=0. Thus, before the wrong-slot terms, the coefficient for phi
is bounded by

    z_(c,j)=[w*_(c,j)+(delta/5)*1_(c!=0)]phi_(c,j).
                                                               (SI5)

This keeps the indicator's actual support. It does not charge the
entire source mass for every cell or every cylinder.

For each of the four non-3 moduli, solve the capacity problem with
z,Ubar,N*+dN. Let gamma_G be its optimal group dual, and let Fbar
be its exact optimum. Keep this dual fixed. Applied to the actual
caps and budgets, the same dual gives

    integral z dX<=Fbar+r*R_phi,
    R_phi=sum_G sum_(i in G)a_i*(z_i-gamma_G)_+.   (SI6)

The certificate independently checks the matching greedy primal
and feasible dual for each capacity problem. No dual optimized at
the unknown actual q5,q15 is subsequently asserted convex.

For modulus3, use(SI2) directly. Including the carrier term in(SI5),
the two complete finite bounds are

    root0:79/900+d0+(4+delta)d1/5+delta/60+(r-r1)/5,
    root1:19/225+(4+delta)dR/5+delta/36
                                       +delta/225+2r1/5.       (SI7)

For the first line use h0>=1/6; for the second use
h1>=1/3-delta/18. These formulas use the same r,r1 and the same X
as all the other original source terms.

Finally the wrong-slot contribution is exactly

    q5*integral_(H)phi dX+q15*integral_(root1,H)phi dX.

The raw cell H caps eta_c/5 therefore give a valid uniform coefficient
B_phi for q5+q15, retaining only cells on which phi(c,H)=1. For
modulus3 the bounds are B_phi=1/30+delta/90 on root0 and1/15 on
root1. For a B-slot indicator this coefficient is zero.

## 3. Project each indicator before pricing its deletion credit

For one independent phi define, on the same five slots,

    g(j)=min(phi(0,j),phi(1,j)), f(j)=phi(1,j),
    l1(j)=min_(c>=2)phi(c,j),
    N0=max_j(f(j)-phi(0,j))_+,
    N1=max_j(f(j)-l1(j))_+,
    Ng=max_j(g(j)-l1(j))_+.                      (SI8)

For these five types f>=g. Repeating124's projection of each actual
original27 label with this phi gives the complete defect prices

    L27=max f+max(N0*(Cbar-1),N1*tbar),
    Lge4=max g+Ng*tbar.                          (SI9)

The wrong cell0 retains phi(0,j); a wrong root1 retains at least
l1(j). All removed and absent original labels retain their nominal
capacities. Summing every positive seven depth and every ternary
depth gives the pure3 reference

    A3=q(g)/90+q(f-g)/135,
    X_phi=(max g/270+max f/135)*(z-D).            (SI10)

The two distinct complete deep-five families from122 add a reference
A5=(1+r)h_r/100 for a modulus3 root r, or
A5=(1+ROOT(c))eta_c/100 for a modulus9 cell c. It is zero for the
other three indicators. Their prices are at most1 on E5deep and
kbar on E15deep; the latter is needed only for a root1 indicator.
All references are for the actual independent test residue. In
particular the worst pure3 price by modulus is

    (3,9,5,15,45): (1+tbar,Cbar,1,1+tbar,Cbar).   (SI11)

The whole-interval comparisons Cbar>=1+tbar and Cbar>=kbar follow
from the positive numerator identities

    Cbar-(1+tbar)=(6-49delta-70delta^2)
                              /[(1-4delta)(8-15delta)],
    Cbar-kbar=(42+68delta-35delta^2)
                              /[(3-2delta)(8-15delta)].        (SI12)

Their numerators stay positive on0<=delta<=1/27. This proves a
safe common indicator price, but the calculation keeps each smaller
individual price instead of replacing all47 by that maximum.

To transport A_phi=A3+A5, retain133's signed slot identity. The
nonconstant slot weight v is1/90 at the test slot for modulus5 and
root0 modulus15, and1/135 there for cell1 modulus45; it is zero
otherwise. Constant terms in j belong to z, not to v. Put

    dA=(v_A-v_Q)_+, dB=(v_B-v_Q)_+, dH=(v_H-v_Q)_+.

The source loss obeys

    A_phi*-A_phi+X_phi<=alpha_phi*delta+10*dH*y1,
    alpha_phi=a5_phi+(dA+dB)/4
                          +(max g/270+max f/135)*3/8.          (SI13)

Here a5_phi is1/900 for root1 modulus3 or a root1 modulus9 cell,
1/1800 for modulus9 cell1, and zero otherwise. These follow directly
from the total nonselected deficit bound delta/2. For cell0 the raw
ternary mass cannot decrease below its face value. Also
z-D<=3delta/8. The favorable p term in133's signed identity is
discarded, while its H/Q migration remains through
u<=r/h<=10y1. Each alpha_phi is at most1/144.

The relevant shifted coordinates are exactly

    y=(E5-gq5,E15-gq15,E27,Ege4,E5deep,E15deep,omega),
    sum y<=rho0-g(q5+q15), y>=0,
    r<=5y1, r1<=5y2.                            (SI14)

For a generic finite LP, add5R_phi from(SI6) to the existing10dH
price on y1. They are added on that coordinate, not independently
maximized. For modulus3 add1 on y1 for root0 or2 on y2 for root1
using(SI7); these indicators have no slot-migration term. The four
deep prices and omega's price1 occupy the other coordinates. Let
lambda_phi be the maximum of the resulting seven prices. Then the
complete individual shallow cap is

    C_phi<=Fbar_phi-A_phi*+alpha_phi*delta
                  +rho0*max(lambda_phi,B_phi/g). (SI15)

Indeed optimize B_phi*x+lambda_phi*(rho0-gx) over
0<=x<=rho0/g. This is an affine one-dimensional endpoint maximum.
It is an upper relaxation of the actual two wrong-slot coordinates,
not a new probability law. The same rho pays cap motion, slot
migration, deep credits and union error once. Different tests have
independent phi but the same actual source and residual.

## 4. Exact independent-layout maxima at the three radii

The certificate computes(SI15) for all47 layouts and all3 first-beta
cells at each stated radius. The maximizing residues are root1 for3,
cell1 for9, slot B for5, root1 times B for15, and a root1 cell other
than L times B for45. The last choice has the expected two-cell tie.
The gap to the next distinct bound is positive at all three positive
radii. This finite layout comparison is not extrapolated to claim
the same maximizing branch for every intermediate delta.

At these radii the selected formulas simplify to

    C3=7/90+delta/5+11delta^2/360-delta^3/360
                       +rho0*max(kbar,2,1/(15g)),
    C9=1/18+4delta/75+delta^2/180+Cbar*rho0,
    C5=14/225+113delta/3600+rho0,
    C15=8/225+2delta/225+rho0,
    C45=4/225+delta/225+rho0.                    (SI16)

For C9, the finite Q-cap residual price is2r/45, paid as(2/9)y1.
Its H wrong-slot coefficient is1/45, and Cbar*g>1/45 on this domain.
The source-credit price is delta/300. All these terms are included
in the single Cbar*rho0 in(SI16). For C5 at B the source finite
price is delta/90, the carrier price delta/75, and the reference
price delta/144, summing to113delta/3600. For the maximizing C15
and C45 residues A_phi is identically zero and the q coefficient
vanishes; only their supported carrier change and omega remain.

| Modulus | Cap at delta=1/50 | Cap at delta=1/27 |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
|3|1616361011/19755000000|79863070759/936726763950|
|9|490849/8662500|126555517/2197935000|
|5|3143/50000|1540493/24300000|
|15|10723/300000|872243/24300000|
|45|5363/300000|436243/24300000|

The implementation may also take the minimum with139's valid cap
and1/modulus. Both alternatives are upper bounds for the same actual
cylinder. These clippings do not alter the displayed new maxima.

## 5. Retain every H1 and LCM-weighted exponent tail

Use139's four complete families with primes(3,5,5,5), starting depths
(3,2,2,2), reference coefficients cbar, envelopes Hbar from134, and

    e=(kbar*rho0,rho0+delta/240,rho0,rho0).

For each family sum every depth:

    T_j=cbar_j*p^-b/(1-1/p)
                   +sum_(n>=b)min(e_j,Hbar_j*p^-n).            (SI17)

The error sum uses its first exact crossing and the complete geometric
tail thereafter. Both large radii have crossings(8,5,6,5). No tail is
cut off there. Add the unchanged complete deep-mixed1/72 and139's
already proved positive-seven bound11/72+11delta/36. This gives

    H1<=C3+C9+C5+C15+C45+sum_j T_j
                                    +1/72+11/72+11delta/36.    (SI18)

The positive-seven slope improves the old exported119/360 by1/40;
this is the precise inequality already established in139 AD13.

For the square, rebuild143's positive LCM sum. A prime-depth n has
ordered-pair multiplicity2n+1. For each family use

    W_p(b)=sum_(n>=b)(2n+1)p^-n,
    sum_(n>=b)(2n+1)min(e,H*p^-n)
                         =e*(N^2-b^2)+H*W_p(N),              (SI19)

when e>0 and N is the first crossing; the error is zero if e=0.
The four multipliers are(1,1,3,5). Thus

    Z=S_upper+3C3+5C9+3C5+9C15+15C45
          +sum_j m_j*[cbar_j*W_p(b)+weighted_error_j]+7/18,
    S_upper=53/360+5delta/9+rho0,
    Q<=Z+(2/3)*[173/48+(671/144)*delta].          (SI20)

This deliberately retains143's original mass upper and raw positive
seven bounds. A stronger separately proved mass estimate can be a
later input; it is not silently substituted into this result.
Intersections at each LCM keep their own residues, so no nesting or
agreement among independently labelled test congruences is assumed.

The exact complete pairs are

    delta=1/10000:
      H1=57313409585226327261182553959
          /116342151640446600000000000000,
      Q=2390141703517481016746127953
          /478774286586200000000000000;

    delta=1/50:
      H1=4800490181389813/9497586656250000,
      Q=86010181885969927/16884598500000000;

    delta=1/27:
      H1=230440811161129319773/446228528542861500000,
      Q=513759940723880055757/99161895231747000000. (SI21)

At1/27, the previous category bounds were H1=0.782761123518616...
and Q=6.320203966946639.... Equations(SI18),(SI20) rebuild the new
upper bounds from their positive terms. They do not subtract one
upper bound from another to manufacture an actual deletion credit.

## 6. Exact finite-source checks and reusable interfaces

The helper also constructs the actual height6 variant398 source from
all its original35 labels, in its period11390625. Independent bitmask
counts reproduce all25 entries of the disjoint-cylinder source formula.
That formula is then used at height12, including the133 operation
moving the pure5 label5^7 from Q to H. Its assigned source parameters
stay fixed, while the actual H masses and slot marginal change.

For each of these three actual cases all47 independent indicators
are checked against their complete mean-credit lower bound, signed
reference change and full transported cap. Both DP14 equalities,
the actual cell caps, all row masses and the single seven-coordinate
shifted budget are checked simultaneously. The migrated height12
case has rho=0.0000027483781418... and lies inside the smallest
reported rectangle. The height6 residual is0.0001410458733..., outside
the exported residual radius; it checks source identities and the
underlying guarded transport only. It is not presented as a sample
inside that radius or as proof of a universal inequality.

`frontier/retained-transport/uniform_shallow_indicator_transport.py` exports
`uniform_H1(par)` with the five original cylinder caps and complete
tail ledger, and `uniform_square(par)` with every weighted category.
`par` is134's parameter record. The semantic certificate retains141
face rows, the literal failed relaxation witness, all141 transported
rows for every radius, the actual-source checks and full source pins.
The ordinary inequalities(SI2)--(SI20) carry the continuous source
quantifiers; finite arithmetic checks their capacity reductions and
the stated numerical consumers.

```sh
python3 -I -O docs/reports/erdos7-odd-covering/frontier/retained-transport/uniform_shallow_indicator_transport.py --check
```

Neither the other source regions nor the complete global comparison
are changed by this independent input. A global consumer must retain
its own mass signs, denominator, remaining costs and every outside
branch before claiming any global improvement.
