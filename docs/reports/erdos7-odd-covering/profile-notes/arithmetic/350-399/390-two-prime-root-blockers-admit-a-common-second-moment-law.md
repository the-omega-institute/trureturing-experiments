# Two-prime root blockers admit a common second-moment law

Let `R` be any subset of `Z/5 x Z/7`. Assume that its second
projection has at least five roots and that it meets every product
of three roots at 5 and five roots at 7. Then there is **one probability
supported on R** for which

\[
 \Gamma_{35}(\nu)
 :=\max_{(b_d)_{d\mid35}}
   \mathbb E_\nu\left(\sum_{d\mid35}
                    \mathbf1_{x=b_d\bmod d}\right)^2
 \le4.                                                   \tag{TB1}
\]

Every divisor residue in TB1 is a freely chosen fixed residue. The
law is fixed before this entire maximum is taken. A layout need not
have a common centre. Three active rows have a direct saturated
construction, four rows reduce to six minimal support types, and
five rows are handled by Hall's matching theorem. No excluded root
is assumed.

The same root laws, when extended by **independent uniform higher
digits**, satisfy a complete-layout second-moment bound at all finite
heights, bounded by the independent auxiliary comparison with bases `(3,3)`.
That extension concerns full uniform tails. An arbitrary source that
meets full-height product trees need not contain those tails, so no
all-height source theorem follows. In particular this does not close
the unrestricted Erdős #7 problem. These are ordinary mathematical
proofs and exact controls, not new Lean theorems.

## 1. Root conditions and arbitrary-layout costs

Regard the first roots as rows and the second roots as columns.
Write `N_i` for the column neighborhood of row `i`. There are five
available rows and seven columns. The product condition implies at
least three active rows; otherwise three missing rows give a disjoint
rectangle. Equivalently, every three rows, including empty ones,
have at least three distinct neighbors.

If exactly three rows are active, the product condition forces
`|N_i|>=3` for each: a three-row set can select `i` and the two missing
rows, and a row with at most two neighbors misses some five-column set.

If four rows are active, the product condition is equivalent to

\[
 |N_i\cup N_j|\ge3\quad(i\ne j).                       \tag{TB2}
\]

Necessity follows by selecting these two rows and the missing fifth
row. For sufficiency, any three-row set contains at least two active
rows, whose three or more neighbors meet every five-column set.
The separate one-coordinate condition gives

\[
 \left|\bigcup_iN_i\right|\ge5.                         \tag{TB3}
\]

For a supported law, let `w_ij` be its point masses and `r_i,c_j`
its row and column masses. An arbitrary complete layout chooses a
row `a`, a column `b`, and a point `(u,v)`, independently; divisor one
contributes the constant one. Its load is

\[
 L=1+\mathbf1_{i=a}+\mathbf1_{j=b}+\mathbf1_{(i,j)=(u,v)}.
\]

Expanding under this same law gives the exact identity

\[
 \mathbb EL^2
 =1+3r_a+3c_b+2w_{ab}
       +(3+2\mathbf1_{u=a}+2\mathbf1_{v=b})w_{uv}.        \tag{TB4}
\]

Consequently row, column and atom caps `alpha,beta,gamma` imply the
useful sufficient bound

\[
 \Gamma_{35}(\nu)\le1+3\alpha+3\beta+9\gamma.           \tag{TB5}
\]

TB5 will handle five of the six minimal four-row types. The remaining
type uses TB4 itself, since the relative positions of the largest masses
matter. Absent rows, columns and point cells have zero mass and are
included in both formulas.

## 2. Three active rows

Choose any three neighbors in each active row and assign mass `1/9`
to each of the nine chosen points. Row masses are `1/3`, column
masses are at most `1/3`, and atom masses are `1/9`. TB5 gives TB1.
There is no requirement that the three chosen neighbor sets agree.

## 3. Six minimal types for four active rows

Delete edges while preserving nonempty rows, TB2 and TB3, until the
support is edge-minimal. A law on this smaller support is also a law
on the original support. The following classification is up to
independent permutations of rows and columns:

| Type | The four row neighborhoods | Edges |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| A | `{a}`, `{b,c}`, `{a,b,c}`, `{d,e}` | 8 |
| B | `{a}`, `{b,c}`, `{b,d}`, `{b,e}` | 7 |
| C | `{a}`, `{b,c}`, `{b,d}`, `{c,e}` | 7 |
| D | `{a}`, `{b,c}`, `{b,d}`, `{e,f}` | 7 |
| E | `{a,b}`, `{a,c}`, `{b,c}`, `{d,e}` | 8 |
| F | `{a}`, `{b,c}`, `{d,e}`, `{f,g}` | 7 |

The letters in each row of the table denote distinct columns. Here
is a combinatorial proof that the table is exhaustive.

**Degrees at most three.** Deleting an edge from a row of degree at
least four preserves every pair union. If at least six columns occur,
it also preserves TB3. If exactly five columns occur, that row has
a shared neighbor: four or more private columns would confine the
other three nonempty rows to at most one column, contradicting TB2.
Deleting the edge to a shared neighbor again preserves TB3. Thus
minimality excludes every row degree at least four.

**A triple must contain the neighbor of a singleton.** There is at
most one singleton row, by TB2. Suppose a degree-three neighborhood
`S` contains no singleton neighbor. If a vertex `v` of `S` also
occurs in another row, deleting its edge leaves all columns present.
The only possible new TB2 violation is that `S\{v}` equals another
degree-two row. Such a row makes both other vertices of `S` shared.
Hence existence of one shared vertex forces all three to be shared,
and minimality requires all three complementary pairs as the other
three rows. The entire projection would then be `S`, contrary to TB3.
If no vertex of `S` is shared, deletion forces the total projection
to have exactly five columns; otherwise one could delete an edge.
The other three rows would then all lie in the two columns outside
`S`, again contradicting TB2. This proves the assertion.

**No singleton.** All four rows must now have degree two. Their
neighborhoods are four distinct edges of a simple graph on five,
six or seven active column vertices. A graph edge joining a leaf to a
vertex of degree at least two would allow deletion of the latter's
incidence. Its column remains present, and the new singleton leaf
is absent from every other row, so every row-pair union still has
at least three elements. Minimality rules this out. Thus components
are isolated edges or have minimum degree at least two. Four edges
on five to seven vertices can only be a triangle and an isolated edge:
four isolated edges would require eight vertices, and a four-cycle
has only four. This is type E.

**A singleton `{a}` and a triple.** Every triple contains `a` by the
previous argument. Deleting `a` from a triple loses no column, so
minimality forces its other two entries to equal a degree-two row.
Two triples would need the same remaining degree-two row, hence both
would be `{a,b,c}` and the whole projection would have only three
columns. Therefore there is exactly one triple, its matching double,
and one other double. TB3 forces the last double to use two new
columns. This is type A.

**A singleton and no triple.** The other three rows are distinct
pairs avoiding `a`. They form a simple graph with three edges on
four, five or six column vertices. It is a forest: a triangle would
use only three vertices. The possibilities are a three-edge star,
a three-edge path, a two-edge path and an isolated edge, or three
isolated edges. These are types B, C, D and F. Type F uses all seven
columns after the singleton is included.

This proves the classification without relying on numerical LPs or
the finite enumeration in section 8.

## 4. One explicit law for each type

For type A use the uniform law on its eight points. Its maximum row
degree is three and maximum column degree is two. TB5 gives

\[
 1+3(3/8+2/8)+9/8=4.                                 \tag{TB6}
\]

For types C and D, use the uniform law on seven points. Both maximum
degrees are two, so TB5 gives `1+3(2/7+2/7)+9/7=4`. Type F has
maximum row degree two and column degree one, giving `25/7`. For
type E, the uniform law on eight points gives
`1+3(2/8+2/8)+9/8=29/8`.

For type B give the isolated point mass `1/6`, each of the three
edges in the common column mass `1/9`, and each of the three private
leaf points mass `1/6`. These masses sum to one. In units of `1/18`,
the row masses are `(3,5,5,5)`, the common-column mass is six, every
other active column has mass three, the common-column atom masses
are two and all other atom masses are three.

To check every layout in TB4, separate four cases. If the chosen
column is the common column and the chosen row is a spoke row, the
first three nonconstant terms have numerator `15+18+4=37`; the
remaining point term has numerator at most 15. If the column is
common and the row isolated, these bounds are 27 and 15. If the
column is not common and `(a,b)` is a supported point, the bounds
are 30 and 21. If it is not a supported point, the bounds are 24
and 15. Absent row or column choices cannot increase the maximum:
replacing an identically zero indicator by any supported one can
only increase the nonnegative load pointwise. The same argument
handles an absent point choice. Therefore

\[
 \Gamma_{35}(\nu_B)=1+\frac{52}{18}=\frac{35}{9}<4.      \tag{TB7}
\]

Equality is attained by selecting a spoke row, the common column,
and that row's private leaf point. Those residues are incompatible
with one common centre. In particular, restricting the maximum to
centred layouts would omit a maximizing layout even in this small
case.

All laws constructed so far, including section 2, also satisfy the
common caps

\[
 \max_i r_i\le\frac38,\qquad
 \max_j c_j\le\frac13,\qquad
 \max_{i,j}w_{ij}\le\frac16.                            \tag{TB8}
\]

The caps and TB1 refer to the same selected law. They are not pooled
from separately optimized probabilities. The displayed laws are
witnesses for TB1, not claims of minimax optimality over all laws.

## 5. Five active rows: a matching or two Hall defects

If the support has a matching of size five, give its five points
mass `1/5` each. Row, column and atom caps are all `1/5`, so TB5
gives `Gamma<=1+15/5=4`. This law need not satisfy TB8's atom cap.

Otherwise Hall's theorem gives a nonempty row set `A` with
`|N(A)|<|A|`. One row is nonempty, three rows have at least three
neighbors by the rectangle condition, and all five have at least
five by hypothesis. A deficient four-row set cannot have fewer than
three neighbors because it contains a triple. Thus only two defects
are possible.

**Two singleton rows at one column `a`.** Each of the other three
rows has at least two neighbors outside `a`: take it together with
the two singleton rows in the rectangle condition. The union of
these outside neighborhoods has at least four columns.

Choose two outside edges per remaining row while retaining at least
four distinct columns. Such a selection exists by the integral
bipartite capacity matching with row capacities two and column
capacities one. Its minimum cut, for a subset `I` of the three rows,
has capacity `2(3-|I|)+|N(I)|>=4`: the empty subset gives six,
a singleton has at least two neighbors, a pair has at least two,
and the whole set has at least four. A matching of size four
therefore exists; extend each row to two selected edges.

Retain one of the original singleton rows and these six edges. If
every outside column has degree at most two, the uniform law on
seven edges has row and column caps `2/7` and atom cap `1/7`, giving
TB1. Otherwise a column occurs in all three double rows. Their other
three columns must be distinct, since the selected union has at
least four columns. This is type B and uses its law from section 4.
The ignored singleton and all other original edges receive zero mass.

**Four rows whose union is three columns `C`.** Every column of `C`
has at least two incident rows among these four. If a column occurred
in only one row, the other three rows would have at most two neighbors.
Pick two incident edges per column, giving six distinct edges. The
fifth row has at least two neighbors outside `C`, since the whole
projection has size at least five. Add two such edges. The uniform
law on these eight edges has row degree at most three and column
degree at most two, so TB6 gives TB1.

The two nonmatching constructions also satisfy TB8. The matching
construction is kept as a separate case below. This completes TB1
for every source in the stated five-by-seven carrier.

## 6. Full uniform tails: a separate all-height consequence

Let `H_5,H_7>=1`, `Q_H=5^H_5 7^H_7`, and lift the selected root law
by independent uniform higher digits in both coordinates. This law
is supported on the full inverse image of its root support. Put

\[
 A_p(H)=\sum_{a=1}^H(2a+1)p^{-(a-1)},\qquad
 A_5(\infty)=\frac{35}{8},\quad A_7(\infty)=\frac{35}{9}.
                                                               \tag{TB9}
\]

In the complete-load square expansion, retain the terms from pairs
of divisors in `{1,5,7,35}` as one squarefree layout. Their total is
at most four by TB1. For every other pair, the congruence intersection
is empty or one cylinder at the lcm. For a law satisfying TB8,
the independent uniform tails bound this cylinder by
`alpha*5^(1-a)`, `beta*7^(1-b)` or
`gamma*5^(1-a)7^(1-b)`, according to its positive coordinates,
where `(alpha,beta,gamma)=(3/8,1/3,1/6)`.

There are `2a+1` ordered exponent pairs with maximum `a`. Summing
only the terms beyond the squarefree block gives, for arbitrary
independent divisor residues,

\[
 \Gamma_{Q_H}(\nu_H)\le F_H
 :=4+\frac38(A_5-3)+\frac13(A_7-3)
                  +\frac16(A_5A_7-9).                 \tag{TB10}
\]

For the five-point matching law use its separate caps `1/5` in the
same expansion. They give

\[
 \Gamma_{Q_H}(\nu_H)\le M_H
 :=4+\frac{A_5-3}{5}+\frac{A_7-3}{5}
                          +\frac{A_5A_7-9}{5}.
\]

Put `x=A_5-3>=0`, `y=A_7-3`, so `0<=y<=8/9`. Then

\[
 F_H-M_H=x\left(\frac3{40}-\frac{y}{30}\right)
                         +\frac{y}{30}
       \ge\frac{49}{1080}x+\frac{y}{30}\ge0.
\]

Thus TB10 also holds in the matching case without asserting TB8
for that law. The separate matching bound tends to `109/18`, while
`F_H` increases to `3541/576<7`. These are upper bounds, not claims
of exact lifted maxima.

For independent auxiliary variables with finite tails
`Pr(K_p>=a)=3^(-a)`, `1<=a<=H_p`, the complete second moment is

\[
 T_H=\prod_{p\in\{5,7\}}
       \left(1+\sum_{a=1}^{H_p}(2a+1)3^{-a}\right).    \tag{TB11}
\]

At `(H_5,H_7)=(1,1)`, `F_H=T_H=4`. Increasing the 5-height to
`a>=2` changes TB10 by at most
`(221/216)(2a+1)5^(1-a)`, whereas TB11 increases by at least
`2(2a+1)3^(-a)`. Their ratio is at most

\[
 \frac{221}{240}\left(\frac35\right)^{a-2}<1.          \tag{TB12}
\]

Increasing the 7-height similarly gives a ratio at most
`(153/224)(3/7)^(a-2)<1`; here the slope bound in TB10 is
`1/3+(1/6)(35/8)=17/16`. Taking any finite path of height increments
from `(1,1)` proves

\[
 \Gamma_{Q_H}(\nu_H)\le F_H\le T_H,                    \tag{TB13}
\]

with the second inequality strict away from `(1,1)`. This proof
retains the original unequal heights. It assumes full uniform tails
throughout; arbitrary conditional or missing tails do not satisfy
the cylinder formulas used in TB10.

## 7. Interface to actual arithmetic sources

The root theorem permits zero in either coordinate. When `3,5,7`
are support primes of a globally minimum-class-count distinct odd
cover, report 375 supplies the one-prime projection bound at 7 and
376 supplies the three-by-five root-product obstruction for its
actual 3-free residual. Those root conditions
also follow for abstract full-height sources satisfying the same
product-tree and one-prime tree obstructions. No normalization is
needed for the root theorem.

A root law can be lifted to an actual full residual by selecting one
actual witness above each of its supported root points. This preserves
TB1 for the four squarefree divisors and uses one actual supported
law. It does **not** establish TB10 for that lift: actual higher
digits may be restricted and correlated. Nor does it automatically
control other primes or all original repeated-prime labels. The
missing continuation is a bound for the complete original divisor
layout under one law on the actual full source.

## 8. Exact controls and scope of reuse

The [standard-library checker](../../../frontier/cover-geometry/two-prime-root-second-moment/two_prime_root_second_moment.py)
checks the six four-row template laws and the five-point matching
law using all `5*7*35=1225` independent layouts per law, including
absent residues. It compares direct integration of the squared load
with TB4 and confirms the exact maxima `(4,35/9,4,4,29/8,25/7,4)`.
It separately enumerates all 135751 row-unordered multisets of four
nonempty neighbor sets of size at
most three in six columns. Of these, 83210 satisfy the conditions;
900 are edge-minimal and lie in types A--E, with counts
`(180,120,360,180,60)`. This enumeration controls the six-column
subcase; the seven-column type F and five-row Hall cases are justified
by the proofs above. Twenty-one full uniform-tail controls reconstruct
2303 source points and 147 divisor-cylinder tables, check the exact
tail scaling and the root/deeper-pair decomposition, and compare its
bound with TB10--TB11. Exact rational checks also verify TB10's
limiting constant, the matching-law envelope comparison, and the two
initial slope ratios in TB12.

The lcm-square estimate uses the existing technique in Chapter 08,
`finite_head_geometry.md` and report 389. Reports 376, 378 and 379
provide the source obstructions and the saturated/forest probability
constructions. The common-law bound above concerns the stated root
sources and their specified uniform lifts.
