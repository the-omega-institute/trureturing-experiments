# Weighted original depths give joint deletion credit; outside blocks still need a shared budget

For original mixed labels d=3^e a b with a dividing1225 and fixed numerical outside cofactor b, comparable-class disjointness gives a sharp all-ternary-height weighted count bound34/9. If b=1, so the mixed condition excludes a=1, the sharp bound is11/3. This allows the original3-exponent layers to be combined in ONE Gram/deletion estimate, retaining their weights and full event indicators.

Different b blocks may delete the same physical mass, so their credits cannot simply be added. There is also an explicit702-label actual odd family for which a head marginal with Gamma_1225<=25/3 has a uniform actual-fibre lift whose original completion load exceeds the necessary whole-cover threshold. The same law leaves positive uncovered mass, and a different supported lift makes the completion load zero. Thus the example identifies a limitation of the specified uniform lift, not an obstruction to every lift or a covering counterexample.

For this same family, section6 proves that every head marginal with a uniform actual-fibre lift has original cofactor second moment above893/81>9. Even exact deletion credit leaves a positive certificate gap; full owners and actual private-owner densities are evaluated under the same law.

Section7 identifies a whole-cover condition that this countercontrol fails: every prime3-private point has a hole on its complete3-coordinate line. More generally, an original pure prime power at minimum positive height has an exact private-product region, and every hole resets into it. This extracts the pointwise mechanism of Reports354 and357 without importing their later whole-cover matching conclusions.

Section8 computes the exact defect in the original owner-pair capacity. Prime privacy forces a positive pure-owner defect under distinct original pure moduli, but enlarging the actual private centers to a whole cofactor cylinder still leaves an insufficient bound. Two actual noncover families separate positive scalar defect and distinct numerical matching from the required joint contradiction.

These are ordinary mathematical results with exact controls. The Gram projection mechanism is reused from Chapter08; no new Lean certification, mathematical priority, or unrestricted Erdős #7 conclusion is claimed.

## 1. A sharp weighted bound retaining every original ternary depth

Let a finite original family have at most one residue class A_d for each numerical modulus d, and suppose distinct comparable moduli have disjoint classes:

    d divides d', d!=d'  =>  A_d intersect A_d'=empty.

An irredundant family has this property: if comparable classes intersect, the larger-modulus class is contained in the smaller-modulus class and is redundant. It is therefore available after taking an inclusion-minimal subcover of a hypothetical whole cover, as well as in the extremal model of350.

Fix an odd integer b coprime to3*5*7. Consider just the original mixed labels

    d=3^e a b, 1<=e<=H, a|1225, ab>1,
    w_d=3^(1-e), I_d(x)=1_[x in A_d].

Other original labels may exist. Labels with higher5- or7-height are not included in this block, and cannot be hidden inside b under its coprimality condition. Missing labels contribute zero.

At each actual full point x, the active exponent triples(e,v_5(a),v_7(a)) form an antichain: coordinatewise comparison would make the original numerical moduli comparable. Therefore

    W_b(x)=sum_d w_d I_d(x) <= kappa_b(H),

where the exact constants are

| Ternary height | b>1 | b=1, mixed labels only |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| H=1 | 3 | 3 |
| H=2 | 11/3 | 11/3 |
| H>=3 | 34/9 | 11/3 |

The statement uses the complete original indicators, including the actual ternary and outside residues. It does not claim that the projected head labels alone remain an antichain when different e are merged.

### Proof and sharpness

Each fixed-e head slice is an antichain in the3-by-3 exponent grid and contains at most three points. Its unique three-point antichain is

    a=25,35,49, with head exponents(2,0),(1,1),(0,2).

For H=1 this proves the bound. For H>=2, if the first slice has at most two active points, its entire weighted count is at most

    2 + 3 sum_(e>=2)3^(1-e) = 7/2,

which is less than both11/3 and34/9.

If the first slice has three points, they must be25,35,49. No later active head can be a multiple of any of them. The only remaining head possibilities are1,5,7. Each can occur at most once, since repetitions at different e would give comparable original moduli. Heads5 and7 each contribute at most1/3. If head1 occurs and either of those heads occurs, its ternary exponent must be strictly greater than theirs. In particular, an occurrence of head1 at e=2 excludes both5 and7 from all later slices; this gives only1/3 additional weight. If it occurs at e>=3, its weight is at most1/9. Thus the later contribution is at most2/3+1/9. At H=2 it is at most2/3. When b=1, head1 is excluded by the mixed-label condition, leaving the bound2/3 at every H>=2.

All constants are attained. At H>=3 and b>1 take the six actual original classes of phase1 whose(e,a) pairs are

    (1,25),(1,35),(1,49),(2,5),(2,7),(3,1).

Their numerical moduli are pairwise incomparable, and the integer1 lies in all six. Their weighted sum is3+2/3+1/9=34/9. For H=2 omit the last class; for H=1 keep only the first three. For b=1 always omit the a=1 class. These sharpness examples are actual distinct odd APs; they are not claimed to be whole covers or extremal covering residuals.

## 2. One Gram estimate across all e in the fixed b block

Let rho be any one finite positive measure on the full carrier. Put

    u_d=integral I_d d rho,
    G_dd'=integral I_d I_d' d rho,
    c_d=integral L I_d d rho,

where L is any real test load on that same carrier. If u_d=0, then c_d=0; omit such labels from divisions below.

Weighted Cauchy--Schwarz at each full point gives, for every real vector v,

    (sum_d v_d I_d)^2
       <= (sum_d w_d I_d)(sum_d v_d^2 I_d/w_d)
       <= kappa_b(H) sum_d v_d^2 I_d/w_d.

After integrating,

    G <= kappa_b(H) diag(u_d/w_d)

in positive-semidefinite order. If B contains the union of this block's original classes, Chapter08's least-squares deletion identity gives

    integral_B L^2 d rho >= 2 v^T c - v^T G v.

Choose v_d=w_d c_d/[kappa_b(H)u_d]. Then

    integral_B L^2 d rho
       >= [1/kappa_b(H)] sum_d w_d c_d^2/u_d.          (WD1)

All ternary depths in the block occur in this one sum. No credit is added separately for each e. In particular the universal coefficients are9/34 for b>1 and3/11 for b=1. If s=rho(B^c)>0, the corresponding conditional upper bound is

    integral L^2 d(rho|B^c/s)
       <= [integral L^2 d rho
            - kappa_b(H)^(-1) sum_d w_d c_d^2/u_d]/s. (WD2)

This uses the actual masses u_d and actual test/forbidden correlations c_d. Separate head marginals or independently chosen phase maxima do not supply them.

The constant is also sharp for the Gram and deletion statements under these hypotheses. Use one of the sharp phase1 families above and put rho mass1/2 at each full residue1 and2. Every original indicator equals1 at the first atom and0 at the second. The direction v_d=w_d makes the Gram bound an equality. For the complete test layout having phase1 at every nonunit divisor of its true period, L(1)=tau(period) and L(2)=1; (WD1) gives exactly the deleted second moment and (WD2) gives the surviving value1.

The fixed-b estimates cannot be added without another joint bound. Take the sharp six-label families for b=11 and b=13 together, using the same two-atom rho and L=1. Their twelve numerical moduli remain distinct and pairwise incomparable. Each block's right side in(WD1) is1/2, but their union has deleted mass1/2. Adding the two credits would assert1<=1/2. The obstruction is overlap under the same law, not a change of measure.

## 3. A good actual head marginal does not control its uniform outside lift

Retain the eight original3-free head classes from447:

| Modulus | 5 | 7 | 25 | 35 | 49 | 175 | 245 | 1225 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Residue | 0 | 0 | 21 | 34 | 48 | 173 | 242 | 241 |

Their actual common avoid-set S in Z/1225 has736 points. It contains the following labelled private structure. Write a point as(r,c,g+7h). At each r=2,3,4 take the five points with c=h and g=r, each of mass3/60. At r=1 use private column g=1 and the four children

    c=0: h=0, mass3/60;
    c=1: h=1,2, masses3/60,1/60;
    c=2: h=2,3, masses2/60,2/60;
    c=3: h=3,4, masses1/60,3/60.

All22 points belong to S. This is449's private law, here called mu; the exact nine numerical cylinder caps give Gamma_1225(mu)<=25/3. The construction is on an actual avoid-set, not an abstract projection supplied with unverified fibres. The736-point source also has stronger previously available bounds; no improvement of its best head constant is claimed.

For any H>=1 and finite set P of primes greater than7, add these original classes:

    3^e : a_e=3^(e-1)-1 mod3^e,       1<=e<=H;
    p   : 0 mod p,                    p in P;
    3^e p : (b_e mod3^e, 1 mod p),    b_e=2*3^(e-1)-1.

The last row specifies one literal CRT residue for each full original modulus3^e p. All numerical moduli are distinct, odd and greater than one. The family is divisor-closed above one. When P is an initial prime segment beginning at11, its prime support is the complete odd initial segment through max(P).

The a_e and b_e prefixes are the two noncontinuing children of a ternary comb: in lowest-digit-first notation they are2^(e-1)0 and2^(e-1)1. All these prefixes are pairwise disjoint. This proves comparable-class disjointness for the ternary and mixed labels; the pure p class is disjoint from its mixed classes because its p-residue is0 instead of1. The original head comparable pairs are already disjoint. No remaining cross-kind pair is numerically comparable.

Each original also has an actual private point. Use CRT with default head coordinate1, ternary coordinate3^H-1, and every outside coordinate2. For a head label replace only the head coordinate by its private point relative to the eight head classes. For a pure ternary label replace only the ternary coordinate by a_e. For a pure p label replace only that outside coordinate by0. For a mixed3^e p label replace the ternary coordinate by b_e and the p-coordinate by1. Disjointness of the comb leaves and the unchanged outside values show that exactly the intended original label is hit. The unchanged default point is uncovered. These are local irredundancy facts about this explicit noncover; no globally minimum-cover provenance is asserted.

The actual3-free residual is exactly

    R_3 = S times product_(p in P)(Z/p minus {0}).

Thus every actual outside fibre has the same positive Haar density product_p(1-1/p). Fix the head marginal mu and take the genuinely uniform law on each of these actual fibres:

    nu = mu times product_p Uniform(Z/p minus {0}).

For every original mixed label its full cofactor event is C_(e,p)={x_p=1}; under this same nu it has mass1/(p-1). Put

    T_H=sum_(e=1,...,H)3^(1-e)=(3/2)(1-3^(-H)),
    s_H=3^(1-H),
    B_H=(3+3^(1-H))/2=T_H+s_H,
    S_P=sum_(p in P)1/(p-1).

The original completion load is therefore exactly

    L_comp=sum_(e,p)3^(1-e) nu(C_(e,p))=T_H S_P.       (UL1)

It is independent of the chosen head marginal. Improving only that marginal's Gamma cannot reduce(UL1) for this specified lift.

For H=4, take all138 primes from11 through821. Exact arithmetic gives

    T_4=40/27, B_4=41/27,
    S_P>41/40,
    L_comp-B_4 >= 16847/16875000 > 0.                 (UL2)

A compact integer certificate is

    sum_(p in P) floor(10^8/(p-1))=102567388.

Multiplying its lower bound for S_P by40/27 gives(UL2). The previous prime cutoff811 does not cross the threshold;821 is the first crossing within this consecutive-prime construction. This family has8+4+138+4*138=702 original labels. No globally smallest example is claimed.

The whole-cover condition in378 requires L_comp>=B_H for every supported law. The explicit noncover here satisfies that numerical inequality under its uniform actual-fibre lift. Hence the head bound and the listed structural conditions cannot force this particular lift's load below B_H. This does not make the necessary inequality sufficient for covering, and does not refute an argument using the additional whole-cover premise essentially.

## 4. The same law exposes the overlap and the remaining ternary prefix

No law change is needed to account for the excess in(UL2). Under nu the outside indicators1_[x_p=1] are independent. Set

    Z_P=product_(p in P)(1-1/(p-1)).

Let tau be the sum of the uniform measures on the two nonzero first-3-root copies; each copy has mass one, so tau has total mass two. A depth-e mixed comb leaf has tau-mass3^(1-e). After deleting the pure comb leaves, the remaining ternary domain has tau-mass B_H; it consists of all mixed comb leaves and the last continuation leaf of mass s_H.

Under the ONE product measure tau times nu, the actual mixed union mass, surviving mass in that remaining domain, and excess multiplicity are respectively

    union = T_H(1-Z_P),
    U     = s_H+T_H Z_P > 0,
    W     = T_H(S_P-1+Z_P).

They satisfy the exact account

    L_comp-B_H = W-U.                                (UL3)

This is the actual-family instance of340's existing incidence/escape identity. It is not a new generic overlap identity. At the702-label parameters, exact rational enclosures give

    0.558689 < U < 0.558690,
    0.559689 < W < 0.559690.

These masses use tau, not normalized full ternary Haar. Divide by three for the full ternary Haar normalization, or by two to condition on a nonzero first root. The terminal prefix3^H-1 avoids every ternary comb leaf regardless of the outside coordinates; its contribution s_H cannot be discarded by averaging the original labels.

The full original Gram matrix also retains this geometry. With t_p=1/(p-1), the cofactor matrix on p is

    G_P = t t^T + diag(t_p(1-t_p)).

The cofactor events repeat at every e. When the actual ternary prefixes are included under tau times nu, distinct e blocks have zero intersection, and the block at e is3^(1-e)G_P. The original e labels have not disappeared. Within any fixed(e,p) block there is just head a=1; this example does not test a nontrivial width-three head block. It shows why local antichain or Gram information still needs a joint account across the different numerical outside cofactors.

There is no obstruction to all supported lifts in this example. Preserve the same mu and assign every outside coordinate the actual value2. This is supported on R_3 and gives every original mixed cofactor event mass zero, so its completion load is zero. The uniform lift and this alternative are separately specified laws, not components selected afresh for individual tests.

## 5. Controls, reuse and remaining obligations

The [weighted-depth checker](../../../frontier/cover-geometry/weighted-original-depth-gram/weighted_original_depth_gram.py) and [exact data](../../../frontier/cover-geometry/weighted-original-depth-gram/weighted_original_depth_gram.controls.json) enumerate all20 antichains of the3-by-3 head grid. A Bellman state retains the available head positions; selecting a slice removes its upward closure from every later slice and discounts the continuation by1/3. It checks230 states for H=1,...,6 in both the full and mixed-only head cases. Six literal original-AP examples attain the stated constants and the same-law Gram/deletion equalities. A two-b example rejects unbudgeted addition of the credits. The proof above covers arbitrary H; these finite controls do not replace it.

The [uniform-lift countercontrol](../../../frontier/cover-geometry/original-prime-private-reset/original_completion_uniform_lift.py) and [exact data](../../../frontier/cover-geometry/original-prime-private-reset/original_completion_uniform_lift.controls.json) reconstruct the702 original moduli and residues, check all2785 comparable pairs for actual disjointness, and check divisor closure with1395 factor-pair tests. It checks each of702 CRT private witnesses against every original class, for492804 membership checks. It verifies the head law against1767 numerical cylinders and all81 divisor pairs, checks304704 ordered mixed pairs with their full CRT compatibility and cofactor/ternary Gram distinction, and verifies the exact cutoff, overlap and escape account. The large common period is not enumerated.

```

The pointwise original-antichain mechanism is already in363 and Chapters40/42; Chapter08 supplies the generic Gram projection. Their fixed-layer statements do not give the displayed sharp weighted count across all e. The proof here supplies that count and applies the existing projection inside the resulting joint estimate; no separate Lean wrapper or new generic Gram theorem is introduced. The ternary comb is already used in Chapter03, and420 gives a different all-centre first-moment obstruction. The present countercontrol retains the actual736-point head marginal, actual outside fibres, original3-bearing labels and the specific B_H completion budget in one family.

The remaining quantitative task is to control the actual c_d and their joint deletion support across b, or to construct a suitable phase-aware supported lift for the whole original family. A count bound does not supply those correlations, and the uniform-lift example shows why scalar head quality alone does not pay their full budget. Arbitrary higher5/7 heights, outside composite supports, and the whole-cover quantifiers remain outside the new sharp block constant. The unrestricted goal is not settled.

## 6. Exact cofactor second moments also obstruct the uniform actual-fibre lift

The same702-label family in section3 provides a stronger test of the specified uniform lift. It requires no new original classes or head source. Keep H=4 and all138 outside primes P from11 through821. Let lambda be ANY probability supported on the actual736-point head avoid-set S. In particular lambda can be the displayed law with Gamma_1225<=25/3, or any improvement of that head marginal.

On the cofactor carrier B=1225 product_(p in P)p, use ONE reference probability

    rho=lambda times product_(p in P)Uniform(Z/p),
    R=R_3=S times product_(p in P)(Z/p minus{0}),
    Z=rho(R)=product_(p in P)(1-1/p),
    nu=rho conditioned on R.

All original cofactor phases are those in section3. For every original3-bearing class3^e d, use weight3^(1-e) and its actual d-cylinder. The sum over the pure3 originals contributes T_H, while every mixed3^e p contributes3^(1-e)1_[x_p=1]. Hence the full ORIGINAL cofactor load is

    W_3=T_H(1+N),
    T_H=40/27,
    N=sum_(p in P)1_[x_p=1].                         (UG1)

For an actual whole cover, union bounding the original classes on each surviving3^H-fibre gives W_3>=3 on R_3. That pointwise implication remains a whole-cover requirement; it is not asserted for this noncover.

Under nu the outside indicators in N are independent with probabilities t_p=1/(p-1). Under rho their probabilities are u_p=1/p. Define

    S_0=sum_p u_p, V_0=sum_p u_p(1-u_p),
    S_1=sum_p t_p, V_1=sum_p t_p(1-t_p).

The exact moments, unchanged by the choice of lambda, are

    J_0=E_rho W_3^2=T_H^2[(1+S_0)^2+V_0],
    J_R=E_nu W_3^2=T_H^2[(1+S_1)^2+V_1],
    D_W=integral_(R^c)W_3^2 d rho=J_0-Z J_R.        (UG2)

Section3 already proves S_1>41/40. Since every p>=11, t_p<=1/10 and

    V_1>= (9/10)S_1>369/400.

Consequently

    E_nu W_3=T_H(1+S_1)>3,
    J_R>9+(40/27)^2*(369/400)=893/81>9.             (UG3)

This is a uniform obstruction over EVERY supported head law lambda for this specified uniform conditional lift. It does not rely on whether lambda's complete head moment bound is sharp.

The exact rational calculation gives the following certified intervals; each omitted interval width is10^-12:

|quantity|lower endpoint|upper endpoint|
|---|---|---|
|Z|0.364555701040|0.364555701041|
|E_nu W_3|3.000999249680|3.000999249681|
|J_0|10.831807983986|10.831807983987|
|J_R|11.181132511931|11.181132511932|
|D_W|6.755662382669|6.755662382670|
|J_0-D_W-9Z|0.795144291949|0.795144291950|

The program retains exact rational values for Z,J_0,J_R,D_W and the last positive gap. The decimal table is only a readable enclosure.

### Exact deletion bounds every owner credit

Let Phi be the vector of the actual cofactor indicators and w the original weights. Set

    G^0=E_rho[Phi Phi^T],
    G^D=E_rho[1_(R^c) Phi Phi^T].

Then w^T G^0 w=J_0 and w^T G^D w=D_W. For ANY valid deletion-owner matrix H satisfying0<=H<=G^D in Loewner order,

    w^T(G^0-H)w-9Z
      >=w^T(G^0-G^D)w-9Z
      =Z(J_R-9)>0.                                  (UG4)

Thus even the exact deleted Gram matrix cannot make the certificate w^T(G^0-H)w<9Z succeed on this family under this lift. This is stronger than saying a particular fractional-private lower estimate was too small. It applies to every such owner choice while rho and the actual original indicators stay fixed.

The conclusion has precise limits. This original family is an irredundant noncover, not a hypothetical minimum whole cover. The result excludes deriving that certificate from the displayed head bound, odd distinct labels, divisor closure, comparable-class disjointness, private witnesses and uniform positive actual fibres ALONE. It does not refute a proof that uses additional whole-cover consequences, and it does not obstruct all supported laws. Keeping the same lambda and fixing every outside coordinate to2 gives W_3=T_H<3 and W_3^2=1600/729<9, as the zero mixed-completion law in section4 already implies.

### Full owners and projected actual private owners are different objects

A fixed actual owner partition can assign every deleted point to the first outside prime whose coordinate is zero. Put all3-free classes first; the original head classes have zero mass on lambda's support. Order the outside prime classes increasingly. The owner event for p has mass

    d_p=(1/p) product_(r<p)(1-1/r).

Conditional on it, earlier outside indicators have probabilities1/(r-1), the current indicator is zero, and later ones have probabilities1/r. Let m_p and v_p be the resulting conditional mean and variance of W_3. The same owner partition gives

    D_W=sum_p d_p(m_p^2+v_p),
    H_full[w]=sum_p d_p m_p^2,
    D_W-H_full[w]=sum_p d_p v_p.                    (UG5)

The exact controls give

    5.439810371312 < H_full[w] < 5.439810371313,
    1.315852011357 < D_W-H_full[w] <1.315852011358.

These owners include overlap points. They must not be identified with the actual private regions U_t in the Lettl–Sun rows.

For an outside prime class0 modp, project its ACTUAL private region vertically along the3^H-coordinate. Since all head originals are avoided, that region is nonempty only when p is the unique zero outside coordinate. The pure ternary comb has normalized Haar mass a=T_H/3=40/81. If N>0, all mixed ternary comb leaves are also present, leaving only the terminal prefix of mass1/81; if N=0, the available vertical mass is41/81. Thus the exact fractional-private density is

    eta_p(b)=1_[p is the unique outside zero]
                *[1/81+(40/81)1_[N=0]].             (UG6)

This formula retains the correlation between private mass and the original cofactor load. In particular the larger vertical private density occurs where that load is small.

Let q_p=E_rho eta_p and v_p^*=E_rho[eta_p W_3]. The projected-private Loewner credit is

    H_private[w]=sum_p (v_p^*)^2/q_p.

For an exact finite expression, put

    b_p=Z/(p-1), s_p=S_1-1/(p-1),
    z_p=product_(r!=p)(1-1/(r-1)), epsilon=1/81.

Then

    q_p=b_p(epsilon+a z_p),
    v_p^*=b_p T_H[epsilon(1+s_p)+a z_p].             (UG7)

The exact controls give

    0.178735778663 < H_private[w] <0.178735778664,
    0.197794573739 < sum_p E_rho[eta_p W_3^2] <0.197794573740.

The remaining private-credit gap separates exactly into unrepresented deleted weight and conditional variance within each private owner:

    D_W-H_private[w]
      =E_rho[(1_(R^c)-sum_p eta_p)W_3^2]
         +sum_p [E_rho(eta_p W_3^2)-(v_p^*)^2/q_p].  (UG8)

Both terms are nonnegative. Here the first lies between6.557867808929 and6.557867808930; the second lies between0.019058795076 and0.019058795077. Retaining partial-private intersections is valid, but it does not make the resulting debit large enough, even before accounting for the stronger exact obstruction(UG4).

All quantities above use rho and its full-source lift Uniform(Z/3^H) times rho. That full-source law is generally NOT uniform on the original period when lambda is nonuniform. Pointwise original-owner or shell identities can be integrated against it, but their previously computed Haar CRT capacities cannot be inserted unchanged. The values in(UG2),(UG5),(UG7) are recomputed under this ONE specified law.

The [standard-library program](../../../frontier/cover-geometry/original-cofactor-gram-uniform-lift/original_cofactor_gram_uniform_lift.py) and its [exact JSON data](../../../frontier/cover-geometry/original-cofactor-gram-uniform-lift/original_cofactor_gram_uniform_lift.json) evaluate these finite rational formulas, verify the disjoint first-zero owner decomposition against exact deletion, and verify every private-owner Cauchy–Schwarz contribution. It runs under python3 -I -S -B -O. It reuses section3's original-family construction and its existing702-private-witness verification; it does not claim another whole-period enumeration, new Lean verification, or an unrestricted odd-covering theorem.

## 7. Original prime-private regions meet every hole line

The distinction between a countercontrol for a uniform lift and a whole cover has a pointwise witness. Let PS1 mean that every ENTIRE prime-power CRT coordinate line through every actual private point is covered. This is the private-to-hole nonadjacency condition of the [original-label interface](../../../../../../Library/Arith/lettlsun2008cosets.md); it concerns actual private points, not points assigned by an owner partition.

### A pure original at minimum positive height

Fix a nonempty finite irredundant family of literal original classes C_s=a_s mod m_s, of period L. Suppose a distinguished original C_t has modulus p^a for a prime p and a>=1, and

    p divides m_s => p^a divides m_s.                 (PR1)

Thus p^a is at the minimum positive p-height of the original inventory. This holds automatically if the original prime modulus p is present. Write L=p^H B with gcd(p,B)=1, let K be the p-prefix of C_t in Z/p^H, and let R_p be the cofactor residues modulo B avoiding every original p-free class. Then its ACTUAL private region is exactly

    U_t = K times R_p.                               (PR2)

Indeed a cofactor outside R_p is covered by a p-free original everywhere on its p-line. Above a cofactor in R_p, every other p-bearing original is disjoint from C_t: by(PR1) an intersecting class would be contained in C_t and would have no private point, contradicting irredundancy. This argument permits repeated numerical moduli when the original classes are irredundant; the odd-distinct application keeps the stronger numerical restriction.

Let Hole denote the actual hole set. Every h in Hole has its cofactor in R_p. Replacing its full p-coordinate by ANY member of K therefore produces a genuine private point of t while keeping every non-p coordinate fixed. Each hole has exactly p^(H-a) such private neighbors. Consequently

    Hole nonempty => an actual private-to-hole edge,
    irredundancy + PR1 => (PS1 iff whole coverage).   (PR3)

Only PS1 at U_t in direction p is needed for the forward implication. Whole coverage gives the reverse implication directly. This does not prove that a covering family cannot exist.

In particular, an irredundant PS1 noncover cannot contain an original prime modulus. If it contains a pure p^a, it must contain a p-bearing original at a strictly smaller positive p-height. A nonempty divisor-closed original set above one contains prime labels, so overlap cannot separate all private points from holes in an irredundant divisor-closed family.

The [extremal normalization](../../321-384/350-extremal-paired-branch-and-source-support.md) obtains divisor closure AFTER assuming a whole cover exists and minimizing first its cardinality and then its modulus sum. It does not normalize an arbitrary noncover while preserving noncoverage and PS1. No such transformation is supplied by(PR3).

### The height premise is sufficient, not necessary

A weaker sufficient condition for(PR2) is that every other p-bearing original be disjoint from C_t. The odd-distinct irredundant family 0 mod9,1 mod15 violates(PR1) at p=3, but its two first3-digits differ. Every point of0 mod9 is private, and every hole still resets to that class.

With the SAME numerical moduli and the changed residue6 mod15, the hole1 modulo45 instead resets to36, which belongs to both0 mod9 and6 mod15. This refutes an unconditional higher-pure reset; it does not make(PR1) necessary or rule out other private neighbors on that line. The difference is the actual phase relation, not the modulus inventory.

### One-law quantitative consequences

Under uniform probability mu on the original period, the product identity and containment of holes in K-complement times R_p give

    mu(U_t)=|R_p|/(p^a B),
    mu(Hole)<=(p^a-1)mu(U_t),
    number of Hole-to-U_t p-edges=|Hole|p^(H-a).      (PR4)

For ONE arbitrary cofactor law beta and an independent uniform p-coordinate, the same mass statements hold with beta(R_p) in place of |R_p|/B. They are not Haar constants for an arbitrary nonuniform p-coordinate. The pointwise reset is stronger than the mass inequality: PS1 requires the actual edge count to vanish, hence rules out every hole immediately under the stated hypotheses.

### The actual702-label family violates PS1 under every supported cofactor law

Keep all original classes of section3 and let nu be ANY probability supported on its actual3-free residual

    R_3 = S times product_(p in P)(Z/p minus{0}).

Use the SAME full-source law mu=Uniform(Z/81) times nu. The cofactor law need not be uniform or a product within its coordinates. The original0 mod3 class is present. Above every cofactor in R_3, all first3-digit0 points are private to this original: the3-free classes are absent, and the other3-bearing comb prefixes are disjoint from its first digit. This private slice has mu-mass exactly1/3.

At that same cofactor, the full3-coordinate80 avoids every pure and mixed ternary comb prefix. It is an actual hole, so the terminal-hole slice has mass1/81. Every point in the displayed prime3-private slice therefore violates PS1. Independently resampling the full3-coordinate while keeping the SAME cofactor gives

    P(old point private to0 mod3, new3-coordinate80)
      =(1/3)(1/81)=1/243.                            (PR5)

These constants apply to every nu supported on the stated R_3. They witness a missing whole-cover condition and do not invalidate the section6 Gram obstruction, which concerns this same noncover under its specified lift.

### Exact controls and reuse boundary

The [standard-library program](../../../frontier/cover-geometry/original-prime-private-reset/original_prime_private_reset.py) and [exact data](../../../frontier/cover-geometry/original-prime-private-reset/original_prime_private_reset.json) retain the original702-class input. They construct a literal integer hole with full3-coordinate80, head coordinates1 and all138 outside coordinates2. Resetting to every value in each original prime's0-root gives177 genuine private neighbors in141 prime directions. The124956 original-AP membership checks equal702 times(1+177); no whole-period enumeration is used.

The small controls include0 mod3,1 mod5,4 mod15, whose prime3 and prime5 private regions have4 and2 points among15, with7 holes; and0 mod9,1 mod45,2 mod175, whose pure9 region has174 private points among1575, with1357 holes. The last family has no prime label but satisfies(PR1) for pure9. The two same-modulus phase examples above verify the boundary of the sufficient condition.

[Report354](../../321-384/354-synchronized-prime-private-cofactor-matching.md)'s(SM3) already gives the prime-private Cartesian identity using only the original prime label, comparable-class disjointness and the p-free residual. Its subsequent coverage of every other root and tail, and synchronized matching, do use whole coverage. [Report357](../../321-384/357-original-private-swaps-and-prime-reset-transport.md)'s(PT6) starts at another original's private region, so a hole cannot be substituted into that statement literally. Its pointwise reset mechanism and(PT9)'s private-product identity supply the same reuse after the weaker premises are extracted; the hole argument above checks the changed source domain directly.

The higher pure-power case repeats that containment argument under(PR1). This is ordinary reuse and a same-law consequence, not a new Lean declaration or a claim of mathematical priority. For the conditional extremal divisor-closed #7 family, the remaining task is to turn the full coverage of these actual private fibres into a contradictory common arithmetic budget or a legal global transformation. Recovering whole coverage from PS1 does not itself provide that contradiction.

## 8. Exact original owner defects and the prime-private capacity boundary

The actual owner partition in the [coset library](../../../../../../Library/Arith/lettlsun2008cosets.md), clauses(OB1)–(OB4) and(OS1)–(OS3), admits an exact linewise defect formula. Combined with the prime-private product identity from section7, it forces positive first-digit defect under distinct original moduli at every prime height. The resulting coarse whole-fibre capacity still does not contradict the private demand. Two explicit original families identify separate boundaries: positive local defects can exactly fit the remaining demand, and distinct numerical-cofactor matching need not distribute suppliers among different prime supports.

All results in this section use ordinary finite proofs and exact original-AP controls. No Lean verification or resolution of unrestricted Erdős #7 is asserted.

### 8.1 One original law and an exact owner-line identity

Let C_s be the ORIGINAL class a_s modulo m_s, with complete period

    L=product_p p^H_p.

Use the uniform probability mu on Z/L. Its global-top CRT decomposition is X=B times Q, where Q=product_p F_p, R=|Q|, and B retains all digits below each global top digit. Write beta for the uniform law on B, so mu=beta times Uniform(Q). These are two factors of one original law.

Fix one total order of original labels and define

    O_s=C_s minus union_(r<s)C_r,
    T_s={p:v_p(m_s)=H_p},
    Z_s=projection_B(O_s).

The owner sets O_s are disjoint and partition the actual covered union, even when the family is a noncover. At a fixed lower source z, an active original class is a hyperplane with support T_s and fixed phase theta_s. Two labels with the same support and phase define the same hyperplane there; the later one has no owned point in that fibre. In particular owner-positive labels of a fixed support have distinct phases.

For a support A put

    Y_A(z)=disjoint union_(s:T_s=A) O_s(z),
    n_A(z)=|Y_A(z)|,
    K_A(z)=#{s:T_s=A, z in Z_s},
    Omega_A(W)=(1/R) integral_W n_A(z) d beta(z).

Here W is any subset of B. For p in A, a p-line fixes every top coordinate other than p. Let h_(A,p)(z,ell)=|Y_A(z) intersect ell|. Each original with support A owns at most one endpoint of this line.

Let tau_(s,p) replace only the top p-digit by theta_(s,p), and define the actual replacement preimage

    F_(s,p)={x:x_p!=theta_(s,p), tau_(s,p)x in O_s}.

Let B_(A,p)(W) sum mu(W^up intersect F_(s,p) intersect F_(t,p)) over unordered original pairs s,t of support A whose phases differ only at p. Pairs with any other phase discrepancy have empty intersection. Two distinct owned endpoints on a p-line yield exactly p-2 common replacement bases, one at each of the other p-phases. Conversely every such pair of replacements recovers those endpoints. Therefore

    B_(A,p)(W)
      = (p-2)/R integral_W sum_(ell parallel p) binom(h_(A,p),2) d beta.
                                                               (OD1)

Define the nonnegative exact defect

    Delta_(A,p)(W)
      = (p-2)/(2R) integral_W sum_(ell parallel p)
                              h_(A,p)(p-h_(A,p)) d beta.

Since 2 binom(h,2)+h(p-h)=(p-1)h and sum_ell h=n_A,

    B_(A,p)(W)+Delta_(A,p)(W)
      = binom(p-1,2) Omega_A(W).                     (OD2)

For odd p, zero defect is equivalent to every relevant line having h=0 or h=p. At p=2 both the coefficient and the defect vanish, so this equivalence is not asserted.

Sum over A containing p and write B_p, Delta_p and Omega_p for the resulting quantities. Formula(OD2) gives the exact slack in(OS3). At a base point x, let

    k_(A,p)(x)=#{s:T_s=A, x in F_(s,p)},
    k_p(x)=sum_(A containing p)k_(A,p)(x)<=p-1.

There is at most one owner per replacement endpoint. Also integral k_p dmu=(p-1)Omega_p on W^up, and the pair service is integral sum_A binom(k_(A,p),2) dmu. Thus the same defect has the decomposition

    Delta_p(W)
      = (1/2) integral_(W^up) k_p(p-1-k_p) dmu
        + integral_(W^up) sum_(A<A') k_(A,p)k_(A',p) dmu.       (OD3)

The first term counts missing replacement supply; the second counts its division among different supports. Both refer to this same owner partition and source law.

### 8.2 Arithmetic inventory improves the cap but depends on the observed digit

Let lambda_A be the total number of original labels with global top support A. For any occupied support A,

    h_(A,p)<=min(p,lambda_A),
    B_(A,p)(W)
      <= (p-2)/2 [min(p,lambda_A)-1] Omega_A(W).       (OD4)

Retaining the actual lower source gives the source-dependent bound

    B_(A,p)(W)
      <= (p-2)/(2R) integral_W n_A(z)(K_A(z)-1)_+ d beta(z).
                                                               (OD5)

Under pairwise distinct original numerical moduli, their exponents at primes in A are fixed at H_p; at every q outside A there are H_q choices, namely 0 through H_q-1. Hence

    lambda_A<=product_(q outside A)H_q.              (OD6)

One useful source-local defect lower bound follows without replacing the owner sets. For a demanded prime set J, set

    g_J(z)=max_(A:K_A(z)>=2)
             K_A(z) sum_(p in A intersect J)(p-2)(p-K_A(z))_+,

with maximum zero when there is no eligible A. The inequalities h<=K_A and n_A>=K_A give

    sum_(p in J)Delta_p(W)
      >= (1/(2R)) integral_W g_J(z) d beta(z).        (OD7)

Indeed sum_ell h(p-h)>=(p-K_A)_+ n_A for each p in A, and any one support's contribution is bounded by the sum of all nonnegative support defects. A positive right side strictly reduces the old capacity; it need not place that capacity below the actual demand.

The choice of digit matters for applying these formulas to a prime-private region. An original prime modulus p has global top support {p} when H_p=1 and empty top support when H_p>1. At a lower source containing its private point, that prime class fills the entire global-top fibre in the latter case. The proper-hyperplane private-source argument cannot then be applied as though this were a top-touching prime target.

Alternatively expose the FIRST digit of every prime and keep every higher digit in the base. An original class is then inactive or a hyperplane whose support is the ordinary prime support supp(m_s). Formulas(OD1)–(OD5) remain valid with this carrier. But the distinct-modulus inventory becomes

    #{s:supp(m_s)=A}<=product_(p in A)H_p.            (OD8)

Each included prime now has H_p positive exponent choices and every excluded prime has exponent zero. The complement-height product(OD6) cannot be retained after this change. In particular the numerical cofactors distinguished by [Report354](../../321-384/354-synchronized-prime-private-cofactor-matching.md) can all have the same ordinary prime support.

### 8.3 An actual odd-distinct local equality control

Consider the following original classes:

| Modulus | Residue |
| ---: | ---: |
| 5 | 1 |
| 35 | 7 |
| 245 | 98 |
| 1715 | 1029 |
| 15 | 0 |
| 105 | 70 |
| 735 | 245 |
| 2401 | 1 |

Their complete period is L=36015=3*5*7^4, the lower modulus is343, and the top cardinality is R=105. The first four originals fix the four nonzero5-roots and have global top support {5}. The next three fix5-root zero and respectively the three3-roots, with support {3,5}. The last original makes the true7-height four and is inactive above z=0 modulo343.

At that specified lower source, the first seven classes tile the entire105-point top fibre disjointly. Every point in it is genuinely private. The full family is irredundant: in the displayed label order, private witnesses are

    6, 7, 98, 1029, 0, 70, 245, 2402.

Let V be just this fibre, of original mu-mass1/343. For a private point whose p-alternatives are covered, phi_p denotes the minimum of sum_A binom(n_A,2) over legal choices of one actual original supplier for each alternative, where n_A counts suppliers with support A. An actual owner choice is one such assignment.

Here every alternative has a unique supplier. At a {5}-owned point, three alternatives have support {5} and one has support {3,5}, giving phi_5=3. At a {3,5}-owned point, all four alternatives have support {5}, giving phi_5=6. Conditional on this V alone, the exact values are

| Quantity | Value |
| --- | ---: |
| Omega_5 | 1 |
| Mean phi_5 | 18/5 |
| Exact pair capacity B_5 | 18/5 |
| Exact defect Delta_5 | 12/5 |
| Original cap binom(4,2)Omega_5 | 6 |
| Inventory cap from(OD4) | 21/5 |

Thus demand plus the positive exact defect equals the old cap. The unnormalized original integrals are these values multiplied by1/343.

The only owner-positive collision supports are {5}, with K=4, and {3,5}, with K=3. Both meet the demanded prime, both have 2<=K<5, and every pair in either support differs in at most two top coordinates. The inventory inequalities hold:

    lambda_{5}=4<=H_3 H_7=4,
    lambda_{3,5}=3<=H_7=4.

Formula(OD7) has g_{5}=18 and conditional contribution18/(2*105)=3/35. Neither this positive contribution nor the stronger exact defect creates a strict demand/capacity contradiction.

The full original family has24811 holes and is not divisor-closed. Complete coverage here is only coverage of the specified top fibre. This refutes a deduction from the stated local conditions; it does not supply a whole odd-distinct cover or address an argument that additionally uses the full extremal hypothesis. V is not identified with the entire private union or all prime-private cofactors.

### 8.4 Prime privacy forces positive first-digit defect at every height

Assume a finite irredundant original family contains a designated prime class A_p, where p is odd. Use its complete period L=p^H B with gcd(p,B)=1 and the same fixed original owner order. Let R_p be the set of cofactors in Z/B avoiding all original p-free classes. The product identity from section7, [Report354](../../321-384/354-synchronized-prime-private-cofactor-matching.md) and [Report357](../../321-384/357-original-private-swaps-and-prime-reset-transport.md) gives

    Priv(A_p)={its first p-root} times {all p-tails} times R_p,
    V_p=(Z/p^H) times R_p,
    pi_p=mu(Priv(A_p)),
    mu(V_p)=p pi_p.                                  (PD0)

No whole-cover premise is needed here. Any other p-bearing original intersecting A_p would be contained in it and would have no private point. The p-free originals are absent exactly on R_p. Irredundancy gives pi_p>0.

Partition V_p into FIRST-p-digit lines, keeping every p-tail digit and all non-p coordinates fixed. Let h_ell be the number of endpoints owned by an original pure p-power label. Each line contains its genuine prime-private endpoint, so 1<=h_ell<=p. The pure-support case of(OD2) is

    Delta_p^pure(V_p)
      = (p-2)/(2L) sum_(ell subset V_p) h_ell(p-h_ell).

Since h_ell(p-h_ell)>=p-h_ell, writing Y_p for the actual pure-owner union yields

    Delta_p^pure(V_p)
      >= (p-2)/2 [mu(V_p)-mu(Y_p intersect V_p)].

Define the inventory sum over ORIGINAL LABELS, counting repeated moduli with multiplicity:

    T_p=sum_(s:m_s=p^e for some e>=1)1/m_s.

Each pure class depends only on the full p-coordinate. Therefore the one uniform product law and the union bound give

    mu(Y_p intersect V_p)<=T_p mu(V_p),
    Delta_p^pure(V_p)>=p(p-2)/2 (1-T_p)pi_p.          (PD)

The basic inequality permits repeated original moduli. Its right side is strictly positive when T_p<1. If each pure modulus p^e occurs at most once, then

    T_p<=(1-p^(-H))/(p-1),
    Delta_p^pure(V_p)
      >=p(p-2)/(2(p-1)) (p-2+p^(-H))pi_p>0.         (PD1)

Pairwise distinct ORIGINAL numerical moduli suffice for this premise. Divisor closure is unnecessary for the upper bound on T_p; when all pure powers up to H are present exactly once, that upper bound is attained. The result retains every tail digit and makes no assumption K_A<p.

The multiplicity condition cannot be silently discarded. The three classes0 mod3,1 mod3,2 mod3 form an irredundant complete partition. For the designated0 mod3 class, pi_3=1/3, V_3 is the full period, h=3 and Delta_3^pure=0. The actual label sum is T_3=1, so(PD) correctly gives zero. Collapsing the repeated modulus into one exponent would give the incorrect T_3=1/3 and false positive lower bound1/3.

This positive defect still does not close the coarse budget. Assume now whole coverage. On V_p all owners are p-bearing because its cofactors avoid every p-free original. Its coarse first-digit cap is therefore binom(p-1,2)mu(V_p). The actual owner assignment on Priv(A_p), followed by enlargement to V_p, and subtraction of the pure defect give only

    integral_(Priv(A_p)) phi_p^first dmu
      <=binom(p-1,2)mu(V_p)-Delta_p^pure(V_p)
      <=p(p-2)/2 (p-2+T_p)pi_p.                     (PD2)

The last upper bound is greater than the automatic pointwise ceiling binom(p-1,2)pi_p. Their difference is

    (p-2)/2 [p^2-3p+1+p T_p]pi_p>0,  p>=3.          (PD3)

Consequently(PD) combined only with this enlarged capacity cannot force a contradiction. A useful further estimate must preserve the actual prime-private centers or pay for the enlarged source through a compatible joint budget.

### 8.5 Divisor-closed numerical matching can coexist with maximal support collision

For any two distinct odd primes p,q, take the original inventory

    {p} union {q^j,p q^j:1<=j<=p-1}.

It is odd, numerically distinct and divisor-closed above one. Let

    A_p=0 modulo p,
    A_(q^j)=q^(j-1) modulo q^j,
    A_(p q^j)={x:x=0 modulo q^j, x=j modulo p}.      (MC1)

The last row specifies one literal CRT class for each original numerical modulus. The complete period is p q^(p-1).

The pure q-prefixes are pairwise disjoint. Comparable children have different p-roots, and a child's comparable pure q-parent is disjoint from it because that parent requires a nonzero q-prefix. The original prime p is disjoint from all children. These observations check every comparable pair.

Every original has a private point. Use the full CRT coordinates modulo p and q^(p-1): A_p uses(0,0); child j uses(j,0); and pure q^j uses(j,q^(j-1)). For the last witness, all other pure q-prefixes fail. Children of lower depth may meet its q-prefix, but have different p-roots; child j and all deeper children fail the q-prefix. Thus no competing original contains any of the stated witnesses.

At the actual full cofactor x_q=0, the complete p-fibre is privately covered by A_p and its p-1 children. The p-height is one, so this includes the entire original p-tail. The alternative roots give a synchronized matching of rank p-1 with distinct numerical cofactors

    q,q^2,...,q^(p-1).

All these suppliers nevertheless have ordinary prime support {p,q}. At the actual prime-private root every alternative has its unique child supplier, hence

    phi_p^first=binom(p-1,2),                        (MC2)

the maximal support-assignment cost. Distinct cofactor colors do not imply different support bins, even with original parents, divisor closure and genuine private witnesses.

The family is an explicit noncover: the full coordinates(1,2) miss the prime p, every pure q-prefix and every child. Complete p-fibre coverage is asserted only at cofactor zero, not throughout R_p. The latter condition would imply whole coverage by section7 and is not satisfied here.

### 8.6 Exact finite controls and the remaining joint inequality

The [owner-line program](../../../frontier/cover-geometry/original-owner-line-defect/original_owner_line_defect.py) and [exact owner-line data](../../../frontier/cover-geometry/original-owner-line-defect/original_owner_line_defect.json) reconstruct original residue membership, one owner partition, all lower sources and complete top lines. They check the line and inventory formulas on the eight-class period36015 noncover, the distinct even period60 whole cover, and the complete repeated-modulus15 partition. The last two are controls of the stated incidence formulas, not odd-distinct covering candidates. The repeated15 partition attains the old cap with zero exact defect for both3 and5; the p=2 calculation in the even control makes no zero-defect characterization claim.

The [matching and prime-defect program](../../../frontier/cover-geometry/original-matching-support-boundary/original_matching_support_boundary.py) and [exact matching data](../../../frontier/cover-geometry/original-matching-support-boundary/original_matching_support_boundary.json) enumerate these instances of(MC1):

| p,q | Period | Holes | Matching rank | Support cost | pi_p | mu(V_p) | Pure defect |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 3,5 | 75 | 33 | 2 | 1 | 19/75 | 19/25 | 19/75 |
| 5,3 | 405 | 142 | 4 | 6 | 41/405 | 41/81 | 82/135 |
| 7,3 | 5103 | 2005 | 6 | 15 | 365/5103 | 365/729 | 1825/1701 |

The defects are unnormalized integrals under the original probability mu; they need not be bounded by one because their integrands include combinatorial factors. Each displayed pure defect attains(PD). An additional higher-pure control0 mod3,1 mod9,2 mod27 has one first-digit line with h=3, two with h=2 and six with h=1. Its exact defect is8/27, above the(PD) lower bound7/27. The repeated pure-modulus3 partition records the necessary multiplicity boundary explicitly.

Both programs use exact integer and rational arithmetic and complete successfully with Python optimization enabled:

```sh
python3 -I -S -B -O docs/reports/erdos7-odd-covering/frontier/cover-geometry/original-owner-line-defect/original_owner_line_defect.py
python3 -I -S -B -O docs/reports/erdos7-odd-covering/frontier/cover-geometry/original-matching-support-boundary/original_matching_support_boundary.py
```

The line identity refines the existing owner cap; prime privacy supplies a uniform positive pure-owner defect under distinct moduli. The two countercontrols explain why neither that positivity alone nor numerical matching alone forces the required strict inequality. The unresolved obligation is a joint estimate on the same original private centers and owner partition, using whole-cover supply to make demand exceed a compatible arithmetic capacity. No sum of independently optimized laws or replacement of numerical cofactors by their supports discharges it.

## 9. Whole coverage needs weighted excess of distinct projected phases

This ordinary finite argument retains every original numerical modulus and every finite prime-power height. It gives a necessary whole-cover demand and a sufficient noncoverage criterion. It does not supply the common outside law meeting that criterion for an arbitrary original family, and is not Lean verification.

Let the original distinct odd moduli greater than one be m_i=b_i d_i, where d_i has all its prime factors in B={3,5,7}, and b_i is coprime to3*5*7. Split the full CRT carrier as X_A times X_B, at the maximum original heights in each coordinate. Write the original cylinder as C_i^A times C_i^B. An absent coordinate has a singleton carrier. Let

    V_A = X_A minus union_(i:d_i=1) C_i^A.

For d>1 and r modulo d, merge the original outside events carrying the SAME projected phase:

    E_(d,r) = union_(i:d_i=d, a_i^B=r mod d) C_i^A,
    E_d = union_r E_(d,r),
    R_d(y) = #{r mod d : y in E_(d,r)}.

All sums over d below are over the finitely many retained numerical moduli that occur. R_d counts distinct active residues; several original labels with the same(d,r) contribute once. This merging does not declare their other weighted-label obligations interchangeable.

The set V_A is nonempty by the published [Hough--Nielsen Theorem1](https://arxiv.org/html/1703.02133v2), already used in [Report526](../500-549/526-supported-unit-mixtures-control-the-sum-of-all-original-responses.md). The A-only originals have d_i=1, so b_i=m_i>1; their numerical moduli remain pairwise distinct and are all coprime to6. If they covered X_A, periodicity and CRT would give a distinct integer cover with no modulus divisible by2 or3, contradicting that theorem. An empty A-only inventory leaves all of X_A. This is direct reuse of a published theorem, not a new proof or Lean result. It guarantees an outside-supported probability exists, but supplies no bound on its merged phase excess.

### 9.1 A distinct retained core has a uniform positive reserve

Take any finite B-family with at most one residue for each numerical modulus greater than one, at arbitrary heights. For each p in B, remove all its pure p-power classes. Distinct numerical moduli allow at most one class for each exponent. The surviving fraction s_p of the complete p-coordinate satisfies

    s_p >=1-sum_(e>=1)p^(-e)=(p-2)/(p-1).

The product of these actual pure-coordinate survivors has Haar mass at least5/16. Give it the product uniform law rho. For a fixed exact mixed support T contained in B, the full exponent vectors of the numerical moduli are distinct. Its total class mass is bounded by

    sum_(support(d)=T) rho(C_d)
      <=product_(p in T)[(1/s_p)sum_(e>=1)p^(-e)]
      <=product_(p in T)1/(p-2).

The four possible mixed supports together cost at most

    1/3+1/5+1/15+1/15=2/3.

Thus the core complement U has

    rho(U)>=1/3,     H_B(U)>=5/48.                 (PE1)

This uses the same actual pure-survivor and exponent-vector mechanism as the [support-incidence theorem](../../../problem-details/50-prime-support-incidence-at-most-five.md). Neither constant is asserted sharp. Missing classes, empty pure inventories and arbitrary finite heights are included.

### 9.2 Extra phases must cover that reserve

Suppose the original family is a whole cover, and fix y in V_A. No A-only original covers this y, so all active retained classes have d>1 and jointly cover X_B. Choose one active residue r_d for each active numerical d. These choices form a distinct-modulus core to which PE1 applies. Its holes must be covered by the remaining active phases. Their number at modulus d is exactly(R_d(y)-1)_+.

Each excess phase has Haar mass1/d. Under the chosen core's pure-survivor law it has mass at most

    omega_B(d)=product_(p^e || d) (p-1)/((p-2)p^e).

Consequently every y in V_A obeys

    F_H(y):=sum_d (R_d(y)-1)_+/d >=5/48,           (PE2)
    F_S(y):=sum_d omega_B(d)(R_d(y)-1)_+ >=1/3.   (PE3)

The core and its pure-survivor law may depend on y. The uniform cylinder upper bound omega_B removes that dependence from PE3; no single retained source valid for all y is claimed. Since omega_B(d)<=(16/5)/d, PE3 also implies PE2. These demands cannot be added as independent budgets.

In particular a whole cover requires at least two distinct active phases for some retained d at every y in V_A. If D_A is the union of C_i^A intersect C_j^A over pairs with d_i=d_j>1 and different retained residues, then V_A is contained in D_A. This is a phase condition: duplicate original occurrences of one retained phase do not suffice.

### 9.3 One outside law keeps the subtraction and all original correlations

For any one finite positive measure eta on X_A, pointwise indicator arithmetic gives the exact identity

    integral_(V_A) (R_d-1)_+ d eta
      =sum_r eta(V_A intersect E_(d,r))
         -eta(V_A intersect E_d).                  (PE4)

Therefore whole coverage implies, under that SAME eta for every d and phase,

    sum_d [sum_r eta(V_A intersect E_(d,r))
             -eta(V_A intersect E_d)]/d
       >=(5/48)eta(V_A),                           (PE5)

    sum_d omega_B(d)[sum_r eta(V_A intersect E_(d,r))
             -eta(V_A intersect E_d)]
       >=(1/3)eta(V_A).                            (PE6)

If eta(V_A)>0 and either inequality is violated, the original family is not a whole cover. Equivalently, one normalized eta supported on V_A with integral F_H<5/48 or integral F_S<1/3 is sufficient. Nonemptiness of V_A follows from Hough--Nielsen as above; constructing one law attaining either strict bound remains an additional obligation. If eta(V_A)=0, the displayed necessary demands are vacuous.

The subtraction in PE4 allows one active phase per numerical modulus for free. Replacing it by original-pair intersections is only a majorant:

    (R_d-1)_+ <= choose(R_d,2)
      <=sum_(i<j:d_i=d_j=d, a_i^B!=a_j^B)
           1_(C_i^A intersect C_j^A).

For such a pair, choose delta_ij congruent to a_j^B-a_i^B modulo d, and translate only the retained coordinate by it. Full retained Haar gives the exact transported overlap

    (eta times H_B)(C_i intersect tau_delta_ij^(-1)(C_j))
      =eta(C_i^A intersect C_j^A)/d.                (PE7)

The shifts can be chosen coherently: for each d fix a reference phase, choose one lift of each original label's phase difference from that reference, and use differences of those label shifts for delta_ij. This represents incompatible retained phases by aligned overlap, but supplies no upper bound on the sum. Distinct original numerical moduli imply that a useful pair with the same d must have DIFFERENT b. A fixed-b Gram estimate therefore does not directly pay for these useful cross-b pairs. Any use of a non-Haar retained law needs its own transport identity and cannot substitute PE7 unchanged.

### 9.4 Complete outside collision can coexist with insufficient phase mass

Set p=11,q=13 and index the143 outside points t=(u,v). Give each its own retained modulus

    d_t=3^(1+t)5^(143-t),     t=0,...,142.

Include two original classes per point: modulus p*d_t with outside phase u and retained phase0, and modulus q*d_t with outside phase v and retained phase1. The286 numerical moduli are odd, distinct and pairwise incomparable: the3-exponent increases while the5-exponent decreases, and the p/q cofactors differ.

At y=(u,v), exactly its own d_t has both retained phases active. Every other active d has one phase. Thus

    D_A=X_A,     V_A=X_A,
    F_H(y)=1/d_t<5/48,
    F_S(y)=(8/3)/d_t<1/3.

No collision-free outside point exists, yet PE2 or PE3 excludes whole coverage. The literal integer2 is also a direct hole because all retained phases are0 or1 at moduli greater than2. This family already belongs to the support-incidence theorem's range; its purpose is to refute the stronger requirement that a successful outside law must avoid every collision. The quantitative criterion needs only insufficient excess phase mass.

### 9.5 Merging phases can succeed when the same-law original-pair bound fails

Let Q={11,13,17,19,23}. Include pure3,9,27 with residue0 and, for q in Q and e,h in{1,2,3}, the original modulus3^e*q^h with retained phase1 modulo3^e and outside phase0 modulo q^h. Pure5 and7 at residue0 may also be included. There are no A-only originals, so V_A=X_A; use one outside Haar law eta.

The useful original pairs are each pure3^e label paired with its same-e mixed labels. Their source-weight energy is

    (sum_(e=1..3)2/3^e)(sum_(q in Q,h=1..3)1/q^h)
      =277120755748135798/830038705801515639 >1/3.

At fixed e, the phase1 events with q-heights1,2,3 are nested. Merging the events leaves precisely the event that at least one outside coordinate is0 modulo its prime. Hence under the SAME eta,

    integral F_S d eta
      =(26/27)(1-product_(q in Q)(1-1/q))
      =54914/200583 <1/3,                          (PE8)

with margin11947/200583. The merged functional certifies noncoverage where its raw-pair majorant cannot do so under this law.

This is also a scope control: the only mixed exact supports are the five sets{3,q}, so the global support-incidence-at-most-five theorem already applies. An additional sufficient criterion demanding small pair energy does not automatically contain that entire established class. Some larger-incidence families may satisfy such a criterion; that is a complementary range, not a containment claim.

### 9.6 The phase-balanced transport obstruction has zero merged excess

The raw-transport obstruction of [Report525](../500-549/525-phase-balanced-originals-defeat-all-outside-laws-and-groupings.md) does not obstruct this merged functional. Take its three-prime family alone: H>=0, K>=1 are integers, q ranges over{23,29,31}, and for1<=i<=Kq use the original modulus and fixed CRT phase

    m_(q,i)=3^(H+i)q,
    a_(q,i)=1 mod3^(H+i),   a_(q,i)=i modq.

These83K odd numerical moduli are pairwise distinct. For the present retained set B={3,5,7}, their retained modulus is d_i=3^(H+i) and their outside cofactor is q. There are no A-only originals, so V_A=X_A. At every fixed d_i, every original has the SAME retained phase1. Consequently E_(d_i,1) is a union of its actual outside cylinders, all other phase events are empty, and

    R_(d_i)(y)<=1,
    F_H(y)=F_S(y)=0  for every y in X_A.            (PE9)

This is compatible with Report525's failure of every outside-law raw transport when13K>H+1: that expense counts original labels whose retained phases have already been merged in PE9. The family was already known to be noncovering, since its whole union lies in1mod3^(H+1). PE9 identifies why that method counterexample does not defeat the present phase-excess account; it is not a new unrestricted covering result.

There is also a direct phase-free estimate for this same finite numerical inventory. Replace each retained phase1 by an arbitrary fixed alpha_(q,i) modulo3^(H+i), keeping its outside phase i modq. At each d_i there are at most three original labels, and hence at most three distinct active retained phases, regardless of outside correlations. Since d_i is a pure power of3,

    omega_B(d_i)=2/d_i.

More precisely there are three labels for i<=23K, two for23K<i<=29K and one thereafter. Thus, pointwise for EVERY outside y,

    F_S(y)
      <=4 sum_(i=1..23K)3^(-H-i)
          +2 sum_(i=23K+1..29K)3^(-H-i)
       =3^(-H)[2-3^(-23K)-3^(-29K)]
       <2*3^(-H).                                 (PE10)

The finite sum is bounded above by the corresponding infinite geometric sum; no tail is inserted as an actual original. For H>=2, PE10 is strictly below2/9<1/3. Every outside probability law therefore meets the PE3 sufficient bound for these83K originals, with their retained phases chosen once and arbitrarily. The raw transport obstruction, when13K>H+1, is unchanged because its calculation uses the original numerical cofactors and outside phase cycles, not these retained residues.

This calculation includes no additional unit originals, retained core, or other nonunit labels. Their support restrictions and phase-excess contributions require their own common-law accounting. The bridge concerns the already explicit Report525 inventory: merging actual equal phases and weighting the remaining excess by its retained depth avoids the raw-label obstruction without asserting that an arbitrary original family has a small-excess law.

### 9.7 Remaining upper-bound obligation

PE1--PE6 apply to arbitrary retained heights and all original outside labels. Their advance is a precise target: obtain one compatible outside law for which the MERGED distinct-phase excess cannot cover the retained reserve. Whole coverage supplied the lower demand, not the contradictory upper bound. The latter must still be derived from actual arithmetic, common-source or minimality relations. Qualitative outside survival is supplied by Hough--Nielsen, but a small phase-excess law does not follow from that existence result alone.

The [phase-excess controls](../../../frontier/cover-geometry/merged-phase-excess/merged_phase_excess_controls.py) and [exact output](../../../frontier/cover-geometry/merged-phase-excess/merged_phase_excess_controls.json) check the constants,130 finite distinct cores on period315, the286-label deep-collision family on all143 outside points, its literal integer2 hole, the merged identity under one nonuniform eta, and the strict same-law comparison PE8. The finite checks are not a proof of the arbitrary-height reserve, which is supplied by section9.1, and no unrestricted odd noncoverage result follows here.

## 10. Anchor phases give a same-law arithmetic supplier

This ordinary finite argument continues section9 with the SAME original family m_i=b_i d_i and complete original-height carriers X_A times X_B, where B={3,5,7}. It supplies a sufficient condition for one outside law with zero merged phase excess. The ingredients are product conditioning, numerical exponent-vector distinctness and the union bound; no new general probability method or Lean verification is claimed. Original heights, numerical moduli, residues and owners are retained throughout.

### 10.1. One anchor per retained numerical modulus

For every appearing numerical d>1 choose one residue alpha_d modulo d. If a pure-B original has b_i=1 and d_i=d, REQUIRE alpha_d=a_i^B. There is at most one such original at any d because the original numerical moduli are distinct. Call an original bad when

    i in J_alpha iff d_i=1
       or (d_i>1 and a_i^B!=alpha_(d_i) mod d_i).

Thus all A-only originals are bad. All originals with the chosen retained phase are free, including arbitrarily many labels with different numerical outside cofactors. The forced choice at pure-B originals ensures that no bad label has b_i=1. Without it an empty-support outside bad event would equal the whole X_A and escape the sums below.

Define the actual outside avoidance set

    Omega_alpha = X_A minus union_(i in J_alpha) C_i^A.

At y in Omega_alpha there is no active A-only original, and for each numerical d>1 all active originals have phase alpha_d. After merging identical retained classes, this is a distinct-modulus B-core. By PE1 its complement is nonempty. Therefore

    Omega_alpha nonempty implies original noncoverage;
    F_H(y)=F_S(y)=0 for every y in Omega_alpha.      (AP1)

The assertion uses one actual y with all original constraints together. It is not a selection of separate favorable y values for different d.

### 10.2. A fixed retained d pays every outside height in one row

For p in A let P_p^alpha be the union in X_p of all bad projected cylinders with outside support exactly{p}. Put

    S_p^alpha = X_p minus P_p^alpha,
    s_p^alpha = H_p(S_p^alpha),

where H_p is uniform on the full ORIGINAL p-power carrier. Suppose every s_p^alpha>0 and use ONE product source

    rho_alpha = product_(p in A) H_p(. | S_p^alpha).

It avoids every pure-support bad event pointwise. For each mixed outside support E, |E|>=2, put

    D_E^alpha = {d_i : i in J_alpha, support(b_i)=E},
    N_E^alpha = |D_E^alpha|,
    z_p^alpha = 1/((p-1)s_p^alpha),
    Phi_alpha = sum_(E:|E|>=2) N_E^alpha product_(p in E) z_p^alpha.

The value d=1 is included in D_E^alpha when A-only originals occur on E. The coefficient N_E counts different retained NUMERICAL moduli, not original labels or distinct phases.

Fix one E and one d in D_E^alpha. Write b_i=product_(p in E)p^(e_(i,p)). At this fixed d, distinct original numerical m_i=b_i d imply distinct outside exponent vectors. For each actual original cylinder,

    rho_alpha(C_i^A)
       <=product_(p in E) p^(-e_(i,p))/s_p^alpha.

Summing its finite actual row and enlarging to all positive exponent vectors gives

    sum_(i in J_alpha:d_i=d,support(b_i)=E) rho_alpha(C_i^A)
       <=product_(p in E) [(1/s_p^alpha) sum_(e>=1) p^(-e)]
       =product_(p in E) z_p^alpha.                (AP2)

This is an upper bound on actual finite data. It inserts neither a new original class nor a new residue at an unoccupied height. Different retained d values are counted separately by N_E; numerical distinctness does not remove that remaining multiplicity.

The union bound over those rows, all under the SAME rho_alpha, now gives

    rho_alpha(Omega_alpha)>=1-Phi_alpha.

Consequently

    all s_p^alpha>0 and Phi_alpha<1
       imply eta_alpha=rho_alpha(. | Omega_alpha) exists,
       eta_alpha(V_A)=1,
       integral F_H d eta_alpha=integral F_S d eta_alpha=0,
       and the original family is not a whole cover. (AP3)

Conditioning is performed once on the common global event Omega_alpha. The zero-excess conclusion is pointwise on its support. This is an outside-law supplier for section9; it need not preserve a separately prescribed 1225 head marginal and is not a proof of the arbitrary-cofactor Gram lift from sections1--6.

If A is empty, there are no bad originals after the forced pure-B choices. Interpret the product source on its singleton carrier and Phi_alpha=0; AP1 reduces directly to the retained-core theorem.

### 10.3. A degree48 sufficient condition with a positive reserve

An explicit uniform specialization of AP3 uses the additional pure-event hypothesis

    H_p(P_p^alpha)<=1/(p-1),  for every p in A.     (AP4)

It gives s_p^alpha>=(p-2)/(p-1) and z_p^alpha<=1/(p-2). One sufficient way to check AP4 is that, after merging identical pure-support bad projected classes, each outside modulus p^e has at most one bad residue. This extra property does NOT follow from distinct original numerical moduli: distinct retained d values can project to different bad residues at the same p^e. The exact pure union mass in AP4 is weaker than that convenient one-residue condition.

Define the bad retained-depth incidence

    D_alpha=max_(p in A) sum_(E contains p, |E|>=2) N_E^alpha,

with D_alpha=0 if A is empty. This is a weighted incidence: a support with N_E retained numerical rows contributes N_E at each of its primes.

Every p in A is at least11. With beta_p=1/(p-2)<1 and |E|>=2,

    product_(p in E) beta_p <= (1/2)sum_(p in E) beta_p^2.

For a pair this is 2ab<=a^2+b^2. For larger E, discard all but two factors first and then enlarge the sum. Therefore

    Phi_alpha <=(D_alpha/2) sum_(p>=11 prime) 1/(p-2)^2. (AP5)

An elementary exact bound for the entire infinite prime sum is

    Q = sum_(p in P97) 1/(p-2)^2
        +1/2520+1/2580+1/2700+1/2760
        +1/2880+1/3060+1/3120+1/3300
      =25333216947944940335217017219727643
         /619258216451156108309703080921860800
      <1/24,

where

    P97={11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,
         53,59,61,67,71,73,79,83,89,97}.

To justify the infinite tail, every prime above97 lies in one of the eight reduced residue classes modulo30. Bound each entire progression 30k+r beyond97, allowing its composite members:

| r | first k | first integer | tail upper bound |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 4 | 121 | 1/3120 |
| 7 | 4 | 127 | 1/3300 |
| 11 | 3 | 101 | 1/2520 |
| 13 | 3 | 103 | 1/2580 |
| 17 | 3 | 107 | 1/2700 |
| 19 | 3 | 109 | 1/2760 |
| 23 | 3 | 113 | 1/2880 |
| 29 | 3 | 119 | 1/3060 |

For a=30k+r-2, the centered-cell integral of (30x+r-2)^(-2) on[k-1/2,k+1/2] equals 1/(a^2-225)>1/a^2. Summing those cells from the stated first k to infinity yields the table. In particular composites such as119 are harmless enlargements. This proves the infinite estimate; a finite list of tested primes would not do so.

Under AP4 and D_alpha<=48, AP5 gives Phi_alpha<=24Q<1. AP3 supplies one zero-excess law, with the explicit common product-source reserve

    rho_alpha(Omega_alpha)>=1-24Q
       =469208737519897511020611152016557
          /25802425685464837846237628371744200
       >0.01818467547.                              (AP6)

The constant48 is a sufficient threshold, not an optimality claim. The exact criterion AP3 can succeed when AP4 fails.

### 10.4. Collisions may remain: a dominant-phase upper test

Complete anchor avoidance is stronger than section9 needs. For any ONE probability eta supported on V_A and nonnegative weights w_d, let F_w=sum_d w_d(R_d-1)_+. The merged indicator identity gives

    integral F_w d eta
       =sum_d w_d[sum_r eta(E_(d,r))-eta(E_d)]
       <=sum_d w_d[sum_r eta(E_(d,r))-max_r eta(E_(d,r))]. (AP7)

The maximum chooses one deterministic free phase at each d after fixing eta. It does not change the law from one d or query to another. The subtraction remains a whole SAME-PHASE UNION, not a sum of independently optimized original labels.

For a source sigma not yet supported on V_A, retain s=sigma(V_A)>0 and put Q_(d,r)=sigma(V_A intersect E_(d,r)). Applying AP7 to eta=sigma(.|V_A), noncoverage follows from either

    (1/s)sum_d [sum_r Q_(d,r)-max_r Q_(d,r)]/d <5/48,

or

    (1/s)sum_d omega_B(d)[sum_r Q_(d,r)-max_r Q_(d,r)] <1/3. (AP8)

These are alternative sufficient inequalities, not additive credits. They permit phase collisions at every outside point. AP3 is the special supplier making every nonanchor phase term zero. No unrestricted upper bound in AP8 is established here.

### 10.5. Two actual families show the criteria have different scopes

For a high-incidence family take ten outside primes Q={11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43}. For each three-element subset E of Q include the original modulus3*product_(q in E)q with retained phase0 modulo3 and outside residues0. Add the original3*product_(q in Q)q with retained phase1 and all outside residues0. All121 moduli are odd and distinct.

With alpha_3=0, only the last original is bad. There are no bad pure supports, N_Q=1 and D_alpha=1, so AP4 and the degree48 criterion hold. The retained prime3 belongs to121 distinct exact original supports; each q belongs to C(9,2)+1=37. Thus the old global support-incidence-at-most-five hypothesis does not hold. Each triple-support anchor has a private witness by setting exactly its three outside coordinates to0 and the others to1, with retained coordinate0. The large class has a private witness at retained coordinate1. Retained coordinate2 misses the whole family. This is a noncover diagnostic establishing scope separation, not evidence of an odd cover or an unrestricted theorem.

Conversely, for e=1,...,120 include two originals with retained modulus d=3^e, outside cofactors11*13 and11^2*13, retained phases0 and1 respectively, and all outside residues0. All240 numerical moduli are distinct, while there is only one exact original mixed support{3,11,13}; its global support incidence is1.

Every possible anchor at each d leaves at least one bad original. There are no pure outside bad events, so s_11=s_13=1, while N_{11,13}=120. Consequently every anchor has

    Phi_alpha=120/((11-1)(13-1))=1.

AP3's strict condition fails for every anchor, even though y_11=1 avoids every original outside cylinder. This demonstrates both reverse noncontainment and nonnecessity: the existence of a collision-free outside point does not imply Phi_alpha<1. The degree48 and old global-degree-five sufficient classes are incomparable. Their failures concern these estimates, not noncoverage itself.

The exact criterion also recovers section3's known successful law on the702-label uniform-lift diagnostic: choose the pure ternary phases as anchors. At each outside p the bad pure projections forbid0 and1, so s_p=(p-2)/p>0, while there are no mixed outside bad supports and Phi_alpha=0. The one outside product law conditioned on y_p notin{0,1} has zero phase excess. Here 2/p>1/(p-1), so AP4 fails although AP3 succeeds. This is reuse of that diagnostic's successful phase-aware lift, not a new analysis of its second moment.

### 10.6. Literature interfaces and the remaining arithmetic condition

Hough--Nielsen Theorem1 already supplies V_A nonempty, as explained in section9. Prime-support minimality is not needed for that fact. It provides no bound on Phi_alpha or AP8.

Theorem4 of [Hough--Nielsen](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02133) allows finite residue SETS at each numerical modulus. The bad outside family can be grouped in that form even when different original labels project to the same b. A nonnegative supersolution to its displayed inequalities is still a premise to prove. Its equation(6) states queries in the supplied modulus inventory; extending to additional queries needs the corresponding extension argument. AP2--AP6 bypass such a supersolution only for their stated sufficient class.

[Scott--Sokal Theorem4.1](https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0309352) can improve a union-bound supplier when its conditional nonneighbor bounds and strict Shearer-region membership hold. Under rho_alpha, disjoint-support events are independent, so the support-intersection graph is available. The required positivity is for the relevant induced-subset polynomials; positivity of just one full endpoint polynomial does not suffice. No such universal positivity is supplied here.

The staged distorted-measure method of [BBMST](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03547) is another candidate interface, but its quoted simplified numerical-modulus moment bounds do not automatically apply to a projected family with repeated b and several residues. Required label/tuple multiplicities and moment estimates under the STAGED distorted laws must be checked. In particular AP2 is proved under the particular PRODUCT rho_alpha and cannot be carried unchanged to those distorted laws. These are missing interface obligations, not a claimed application already completed.

The [squarefree parallel-hyperplane theorem](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.11465) has its own odd-prime product-box and proper-support hypotheses. It supplies no arbitrary-height extension of AP3. The present construction permits arbitrary finite original heights because it retains them and explicitly sums their distinct exponent vectors.

The unresolved arithmetic issue is now explicit: original distinctness pays all outside cofactors within a fixed retained d, but does not by itself control the repetition N_E across different d, the actual pure survivor masses s_p, or the weaker weighted dominant-phase deficits. Section11 below retains the weights before summing retained depths and supplies further sufficient classes, but no implication from unrestricted whole-cover minimality or private witnesses to a successful anchor or an AP8 bound has been proved. The240-label example also prevents treating AP3 as a necessary description of successful outside laws. The unrestricted odd-covering goal remains open in this route.

### 10.7. Exact finite controls

The exact rational controls verify the prime-tail constants and reserve, the two scope-separation families, each fixed-d row bound in one actual CRT source, and the merged subtraction identity under one common product law. The actual12-label CRT source has full outside heights11^2 and13, pure survivor masses98/121 and12/13,1176 product-source points and1142 points after all bad events are removed. Its values are

    rho_alpha(Omega_alpha)=571/588,
    Phi_alpha=1573/47040.

Every retained outside point avoids A-only originals and has zero distinct-phase excess. Its pure-event mass at11 violates AP4, while AP3 succeeds, checking the distinction between exact and simplified suppliers. These finite tests are controls of the stated formulas; the proofs of arbitrary finite heights and the infinite tail are the arguments above, and no Lean or unrestricted whole-cover result is inferred from the controls.

The [anchor-phase controls](../../../frontier/cover-geometry/merged-phase-excess/anchor_phase_controls.py) and [exact output](../../../frontier/cover-geometry/merged-phase-excess/anchor_phase_controls.json) retain these finite checks. Run the program with an explicit `--output` path.

## 11. Retained weights pay arbitrary depth multiplicity under one outside law

This continues sections9--10 with the original finite distinct odd moduli, full original heights, numerical retained moduli and phase unions unchanged. The result is a sufficient ordinary mathematical criterion. It allows phase collisions and arbitrarily many retained numerical depths on one outside support, but requires the stated common-source and incidence bounds. It is not an unrestricted noncoverage theorem or a Lean result.

### 11.1. Weighted rows under an actual cylinder-cap source

For each occurring d>1 fix an anchor phase alpha_d, forced to be the original retained phase if a pure-B original with b_i=1 occurs. There is at most one such original at each d. Define the NONANCHOR depth set of a nonempty outside support E by

    D_(E,+)^alpha = {d>1: some original i has d_i=d,
                     support(b_i)=E, a_i^B!=alpha_d},
    W_E(w) = sum_(d in D_(E,+)^alpha) w_d,

where all w_d are nonnegative. The plus sign distinguishes this set from AP2's D_E^alpha, which can also contain the A-only row d=1.

Let sigma be ONE probability on the full actual outside carrier, and suppose

    s=sigma(V_A)>0,   eta=sigma(. | V_A).

Suppose nonnegative c_(p,e) bound every actual original outside cylinder by

    sigma(C_i^A)<=product_(p in support(b_i)) c_(p,e_(i,p)),
    Lambda_p=sum_(e>=1)c_(p,e)<infinity.

Only actual finite-height cylinders need such bounds; values above the carrier's maximum original height may be zero or any larger summable majorant. Sigma need not be a product measure. Then

    integral F_w d eta
      <= (1/s) sum_(nonempty E) W_E(w) product_(p in E) Lambda_p,
    F_w(y)=sum_(d>1)w_d (R_d(y)-1)_+.             (WR1)

Indeed, pointwise,

    (R_d-1)_+ <= sum_(r!=alpha_d) 1_(E_(d,r)).

The inequality holds even when the chosen anchor is inactive: in that case its right side is R_d. Integrate under eta, union-bound the actual originals in each nonanchor phase, and use eta(C)<=sigma(C)/s. At a FIXED numerical d and outside support E, distinct original m_i=d b_i imply distinct full positive exponent vectors of b_i. Thus

    sum_(i:d_i=d,support(b_i)=E,a_i^B!=alpha_d) sigma(C_i^A)
       <=sum_((e_p) in positive integers^E) product_(p in E)c_(p,e_p)
       =product_(p in E)Lambda_p.

Multiplying by w_d and summing gives WR1. The forced pure-B anchor ensures no nonanchor cylinder has empty outside support. No distinctness is asserted after varying d or projecting away its numerical value.

### 11.2. One shared envelope can replace many same-phase supports

For each nonanchor(d,r), let A_(d,r) be a finite family of actual outside events with controlled sigma masses. Assign nonnegative gamma_(d,r,A) such that EVERY original i at that phase obeys

    sum_(A: V_A intersect C_i^A subset A) gamma_(d,r,A)>=1.

For y in V_A intersect E_(d,r), choose one original cylinder containing it. Every envelope in the displayed sum contains y, so

    1_(E_(d,r))(y)<=sum_A gamma_(d,r,A)1_A(y).

The same pointwise excess bound therefore gives

    integral F_w d eta
       <=(1/s)sum_(d>1)w_d sum_(r!=alpha_d)
                 sum_A gamma_(d,r,A) sigma(V_A intersect A). (WR2)

All envelope masses and the denominator belong to ONE sigma. Different phases may share an envelope, but each phase cost is still charged as displayed; no unjustified cross-phase discount is taken. Actual-cylinder envelopes recover the pre-row version of WR1. A common coordinate cylinder can instead pay once for a whole phase union across many different supports. This is a sufficient fractional cover, not an assertion that its optimal cost has an unrestricted arithmetic bound.

### 11.3. Pure-deleted product specialization with one conditioning

Use section10.2's actual product source rho_alpha, with all s_p^alpha>0 and z_p^alpha=1/((p-1)s_p^alpha). All bad singleton-support events, including A-only ones, are already excluded pointwise. Put

    E_0={E:|E|>=2 and some A-only original has support E},
    U_0=sum_(E in E_0)product_(p in E)z_p^alpha,
    Psi_w=sum_(E:|E|>=2)W_E(w)product_(p in E)z_p^alpha.

The fixed d=1 exponent-vector bound gives

    s=rho_alpha(V_A)>=1-U_0.

If U_0<1, the SAME law eta=rho_alpha(. | V_A) satisfies

    integral F_w d eta<=Psi_w/s<=Psi_w/(1-U_0).    (WR3)

Consequently either of the following suffices for original noncoverage:

    Psi_H < (5/48)(1-U_0),   w_d=1/d;
    Psi_S < (1/3)(1-U_0),    w_d=omega_B(d).       (WR4)

These alternative tests consume PE2 and PE3; they are not additive credits. One can replace 1-U_0 by the actual positive s when it is known. Unlike AP3, eta conditions only on avoiding A-only originals, and may give positive probability to several retained phases at the same d.

### 11.4. Support incidence replaces the number of retained numerical rows

Assume the additional pure-event hypothesis AP4. Put beta_p=1/(p-2), so z_p^alpha<=beta_p. Let Q be the EXPLICIT RATIONAL UPPER BOUND on the infinite prime-square sum proved in section10.3; Q<1/24. Define

    Delta_0=max_p #{E in E_0:p in E},
    Delta_w=max_p sum_(E contains p,|E|>=2)W_E(w),

with empty maxima zero. The product inequality from AP5 gives

    U_0<=Delta_0 Q/2,   Psi_w<=Delta_w Q/2.

It follows that each of these inequalities suffices:

    48 Delta_H+5 Delta_0<=240;                    (WR5H)
    3 Delta_S+Delta_0<=48.                        (WR5S)

For WR5H, Delta_0<=48 and hence 1-Delta_0 Q/2>0. The desired strict inequality is equivalent to

    Q(48 Delta_H+5 Delta_0)<10,

which follows from Q<1/24 and WR5H. The zero-coefficient case also satisfies it. The WR5S rearrangement is Q(3 Delta_S+Delta_0)<2. This verifies the denominator and strictness, including equality in the incidence hypotheses.

The complete retained-weight sums over ALL B-smooth numerical d>1 are

    sum_d 1/d = (3/2)(5/4)(7/6)-1=19/16,
    sum_d omega_B(d)
       =product_(p in B)(1+1/(p-2))-1=11/5.

Let k be the largest number of DISTINCT mixed outside support sets E incident at one outside prime with D_(E,+)^alpha nonempty, and put k_0=Delta_0. A support is counted once regardless of how many retained d or original labels occur on it. Then

    Delta_H<=(19/16)k,   Delta_S<=(11/5)k.

Thus two simpler sufficient conditions are

    57k+5k_0<=240;                               (WR6H)
    33k+5k_0<=240.                               (WR6S)

In particular, when there are no mixed-support A-only originals, k<=4 suffices for WR6H, and k<=7 for WR6S. Arbitrarily many distinct retained d and arbitrary finite original heights are allowed on each support. These statements retain AP4; original distinctness does not imply it. They extend the available weighted supplier beyond the earlier degree48 test, which counted retained rows. They do not assert that every earlier degree48 instance satisfies these coarser conditions.

### 11.5. The existing240-label family has positive collisions and small excess

Take section10.5's original family with d=3^e, 1<=e<=120, one original at outside cofactor11*13 and retained phase0, and another at11^2*13 and retained phase1. Outside residues are zero. All240 original numerical moduli are distinct. There are no A-only or singleton-outside originals, so rho_alpha is the complete uniform outside law and s=1. Choose alpha_(3^e)=0.

The unweighted AP3 row envelope is Phi_alpha=120/(10*12)=1 and does not certify avoidance. Its incidence exceeds48. In contrast

    W_{11,13}(H)=(1-3^(-120))/2,
    W_{11,13}(S)=1-3^(-120),
    Psi_H=(1-3^(-120))/240 <5/48,
    Psi_S=(1-3^(-120))/120 <1/3.                  (WR7)

Both weighted tests succeed under one uniform law. The phase1 outside cylinder is contained in the phase0 cylinder and has mass1/1573. At each d the excess equals the indicator of that smaller cylinder. Hence the EXACT common-law expectations are

    integral F_H d eta=(1-3^(-120))/3146,
    integral F_S d eta=(1-3^(-120))/1573.          (WR8)

These are positive. The result permits actual collisions rather than implicitly finding a collision-free law.

The conditioning denominator is independently necessary. Use original moduli11,3,33, with outside-only residue0 modulo11, pure retained phase0 modulo3, and the33 class having retained phase1 and outside residue1 modulo11. The one outside uniform law has s=10/11. The sole nonanchor event has unconditioned mass1/11 but conditioned mass1/10, giving integral F_H=1/30 rather than1/33. Omitting s in the pre-row or envelope inequality would fail even in this complete three-label family.

### 11.6. Support-row costs can diverge while a phase envelope stays small

For any finite set P of primes greater than11, take the distinct odd original moduli

    3*11*p at retained phase0,
    3*11^2*p at retained phase1,  for p in P,

with all outside residues zero. There are no A-only originals. For anchor0, WR1's H row envelope under uniform outside Haar is

    (1/30)sum_(p in P)1/(p-1).                    (WR9)

This grows without bound along increasing finite prime sets, by divergence of the sum of reciprocal primes. Anchor1 has the same exponent-vector row envelope; another anchor cannot decrease it. Even the unsummed original-cylinder majorant for anchor0 is (1/363)sum_(p in P)1/p, also unbounded.

However, with U_P=union_(p in P){x_p=0}, the actual merged phase events are

    E_(3,0)={x_11=0 mod11} intersect U_P,
    E_(3,1)={x_11=0 mod121} intersect U_P,

and the latter is contained in the former. The EXACT expectation is

    integral F_H d eta
       =(1/363)(1-product_(p in P)(1-1/p))<1/363<5/48,
    integral F_S d eta=2 integral F_H d eta<2/363<1/3. (WR10)

One envelope {x_11=0 mod121}, with coefficient1, covers every phase1 original and gives the bounded WR2 cost1/363. These actual families show that weighted numerical-depth rows do not by themselves control arbitrarily many outside supports. The obstruction concerns that estimate, not original noncoverage or the general phase-excess criterion.

The outstanding unrestricted obligation is a simultaneous arithmetic upper bound on same-phase envelope costs under ONE suitable outside law, or another whole-cover consequence supplying PE2/PE3's strict reverse. WR1--WR10 do not establish it.

### 11.7. Actual original-label controls

The [weighted-phase control program](../../../frontier/cover-geometry/merged-phase-excess/weighted_phase_rows_controls.py) and [data](../../../frontier/cover-geometry/merged-phase-excess/weighted_phase_rows_controls.json) reconstruct every original numerical residue by CRT and check all247 original labels in the three families of sections11.5--11.6. Across their complete outside carriers,28325 points are examined. The shared-envelope fixture takes P={13,17} and gives exact H expectation29/80223. The program also checks all333 criterion-labelled nonnegative integer(k,k_0) cases satisfying their displayed degree condition, using section10.3's rational Q bound. These finite controls do not replace the all-height, arbitrary-support-count proofs or the infinite-tail estimate.

```sh
python3 -I -S -B -O docs/reports/erdos7-odd-covering/frontier/cover-geometry/merged-phase-excess/weighted_phase_rows_controls.py --output docs/reports/erdos7-odd-covering/frontier/cover-geometry/merged-phase-excess/weighted_phase_rows_controls.json
```

## 12. A literal noncover forbids every unconditional low-excess law

The unrestricted supplier suggested in sections9 and11 cannot hold for
every original odd-distinct family. There is a452-class family with an
explicit integer hole for which EVERY outside survivor satisfies

    F_S(y)>=256/735=1/3+11/735,
    F_H(y)>=(5/16)F_S(y)>=16/147=5/48+11/2352.       (UC1)

Consequently no probability supported on its actual outside-only avoiding
set gives either strict reverse of PE2 or PE3. This is an obstruction to
an unconditional sufficient criterion, not an odd covering system. The
necessary whole-cover implications PE2/PE3 and the conditional suppliers
AP1--AP8 and WR1--WR10 remain valid. Section13 additionally rules out a
supplier based only on union-irredundancy and numerical divisor closure.
A supplier using further consequences of a hypothetical whole cover or
extremality among whole covers remains a separate open question.

### 12.1. Complete numerical original classes

Let B={3,5,7}, A={11,13,17,19}, and Q=46189. The retained numerical moduli
are

    D={3,5,7,9,15,21,25,27,35,45,49,63,75,81,
       105,125,135,147,175,189,225,243,245,315,
       343,375,405,441}.

The [original-class input](../../../frontier/cover-geometry/merged-phase-excess/universal_phase_supplier_originals.json)
specifies every class solely by its full integer modulus and residue. It
has four outside-only classes0 modp, p in A; one pure retained class1 modd
for every d in D; and one mixed class at each modulus db, for every d in D
and every nonempty squarefree divisor b of Q. Thus the class count is

    4+28+28(2^4-1)=452.

For clarity, those outside cofactors in increasing support size and then
numerical order are

    b_j=(11,13,17,19,143,187,209,221,247,323,
         2431,2717,3553,4199,46189),  j=0,...,14.

Each mixed class has retained phase2+(j mod(d-2)), hence a nonzero phase
different from1. Its complete residue, including the actual outside
phase, is fixed by the numerical input. No choice of a residue is made
separately for different outside points or probability laws.

Unique prime factorization separates all pairs(d,b), as well as the
outside-only and pure retained classes. All452 original numerical moduli
are therefore distinct, odd, and greater than one. Their common period
and the retained period are

    L_B=lcm(D)=10418625,
    L=L_B Q=481225870125.

The literal integer

    h=64366265250,   h=0 modL_B,   h=1 modQ          (UC2)

avoids every original class: its outside coordinate avoids all0 modp
classes, and its retained coordinate0 avoids every pure or mixed retained
phase. The numerical verifier also checks h against each full original
pair(m,a). No irredundancy or inclusion-minimality property is asserted.

### 12.2. Exact pointwise merged-phase certificate

The actual outside-only avoiding set is exactly

    V_A={0<=y<Q: y modp!=0 for each p in A},
    |V_A|=10*12*16*18=34560.

At each retained numerical d and actual y, form the SET

    P_d(y)={a modd: (m,a) an original class,
                    B-part(m)=d, y mod(m/d)=a mod(m/d)}.

It always contains1, by the pure retained original. Set R_d(y)=|P_d(y)|.
Repeated equal phases from different original cofactors are merged before
counting. With the same retained weights as PE3, put

    omega_B(d)=product_(p^e||d) (p-1)/((p-2)p^e),
    W_d=L_B omega_B(d),
    N(y)=sum_(d in D) W_d (|P_d(y)|-1).             (UC3)

Every W_d is an integer. Evaluation of UC3 at ALL34560 actual outside
survivors gives

    min N(y)=3628800,
    {y in V_A:N(y)=3628800}={19802},
    min F_S=3628800/10418625=256/735.              (UC4)

The [checker](../../../frontier/cover-geometry/merged-phase-excess/universal_phase_supplier_obstruction.py)
starts from the numerical(m,a) pairs, factors out their B-parts, and
reconstructs every retained phase and outside congruence. It enumerates
the entire nonzero CRT carrier, constructs a bitset for each outside
coordinate event, and unions the original events at the same(d,phase)
before adding their integer weights. Thus it computes UC3 without using
projected labels or heuristic search scores as premises. Its
[exact result](../../../frontier/cover-geometry/merged-phase-excess/universal_phase_supplier_obstruction.json)
includes the minimum, unique minimizer, literal hole, input hash, and
hash of all numerical-survivor/score pairs. A separate direct-set
computation agreed at every one of those34560 pairs. All substantive
checks use explicit exceptions and remain active with Python optimization.

Finally

    d omega_B(d)
       =product_(p|d) (p-1)/(p-2)<=2*(4/3)*(6/5)=16/5.

The excesses are nonnegative, so F_S<=(16/5)F_H. Combining this with UC4
proves UC1 pointwise. Integrating UC1 against ANY supported probability
gives the same lower bounds. The obstruction survives all changes of the
outside law, including nonproduct laws and point masses; it is not merely
a failure of the uniform law or an upper estimate.

### 12.3. The remaining whole-cover obligation

This example has a retained zero hole above every outside survivor, while
its number of other active phases exceeds both scalar reserve thresholds.
It shows exactly what the phase-count scalar omits: the actual position
of the uncovered retained set relative to the additional phases. A
sufficient upper-bound test need not recognize every noncover.

Therefore the unrestricted task cannot be reduced to proving a strict
PE2/PE3 reverse for all original families. A continuation must either use
additional structure of a hypothetical whole cover to supply that
reverse, or preserve more of the joint retained-phase geometry in a
different contradiction. Sections9--11 supply conditional tools for that
task, not the missing universal statement. Erdős #7 remains open here.

This is an ordinary finite certificate, not new Lean verification.
Reproduce it from the repository root with explicit input and output:

```

### 12.4. Containment reduction removes this particular obstruction

The452-class example does not obstruct the same supplier after a
union-preserving reduction. For classes A=(a modulo m) and C=(c modulo n),
with m>n, the conditions n divides m and a=c modulo n imply A is contained
in C. Delete every original class properly contained in another original
class. Finite descent in the numerical modulus ensures that every deleted
class is contained in one of the retained classes. Thus the covered subset
of the integers is EXACTLY unchanged. Numerical distinctness and oddness
also persist; no new class or residue is introduced.

For the complete numerical input of UC1, this leaves263 original classes
and deletes189. Each deletion has a retained containing class, explicitly
recorded in the [exact reduction data](../../../frontier/cover-geometry/merged-phase-excess/universal_phase_supplier_containment_reduction.json).
The four outside-only classes are still precisely0 modulo11,13,17,19.
Take the SINGLE outside coordinate

    y=24950 modulo46189,
    (y modulo11,13,17,19)=(2,3,11,3).

It belongs to the unchanged outside survivor set. Reconstructing the
active retained phases from all263 FULL numerical originals gives exactly

    (d,r)=(3,1),(5,1),(7,1),(49,3),(63,5),
          (75,2),(105,3),(125,2),(147,2),(243,2).

All other retained numerical rows have no active phase at this y. Every
row therefore has at most one phase, and the reduced family has

    F_S(y)=F_H(y)=0.                              (UC5)

Since each excess summand is nonnegative, zero is also the exact global
minimum of each reduced excess on V_A; an exhaustive search is unnecessary
to certify that minimum. The point mass at this common y is one supported
law for every retained numerical row. By contrast, the ORIGINAL452 classes
at this SAME y have

    F_S(y)=118982/297675>1/3,
    F_H(y)=291596/1488375>5/48.

Thus the scalar excess is not invariant under an exact preservation of the
covered set. This leaves UC1--UC4 intact for their stated original family,
but prevents using that example to rule out a supplier restricted to
containment-free families or to a genuinely minimal whole cover. The263
retained classes have no pairwise class containment; this does NOT assert
that none is covered by a UNION of the others. No inclusion-minimality or
universal low-excess theorem is inferred.

The [numerical verifier](../../../frontier/cover-geometry/merged-phase-excess/universal_phase_supplier_containment_reduction.py)
checks all189 retained-containment witnesses, the unchanged outside-only
family, all active original congruences at y, and both exact excesses. A
separate complete outside-carrier probe also found minimum zero; UC5 and
nonnegativity already provide the exact certificate. Reproduce with:

python3 -I -S -B -O docs/reports/erdos7-odd-covering/frontier/cover-geometry/merged-phase-excess/universal_phase_supplier_containment_reduction.py --input docs/reports/erdos7-odd-covering/frontier/cover-geometry/merged-phase-excess/universal_phase_supplier_originals.json --output /tmp/e7_phase_containment_reduction.json
```

This reduction concerns precisely the original452-class input. The
different463-class family in section13 has no union-redundant original,
yet defeats both suppliers at every outside survivor. Thus a universal
repair based only on removing redundant classes is unavailable; the
remaining task needs further whole-cover structure. Neither diagnostic
settles Erdős #7 or asserts new Lean verification.

## 13. Irredundancy and divisor closure do not supply a low-excess law

There is a463-class family of distinct odd numerical moduli greater than
one with ALL of the following properties simultaneously:

- its numerical inventory is closed under every nonunit divisor;
- its exact prime support is {3,5,7,11,13,17,19}, and each original prime
  class is0 modulo its prime;
- each original class has a private integer belonging to no other class;
- a literal integer avoids the entire family;
- every probability supported on its actual outside-only survivor set
  violates both strict low-excess sufficient conditions from PE2/PE3.

The [literal certificate](../../../frontier/cover-geometry/merged-phase-excess/irredundant_divisor_closed_phase_obstruction_originals.json)
contains only full numerical moduli, full numerical residues, one private
integer per original, and an uncovered integer. Its SHA256 is

    427138d17d61f284dff84c2143b90b3b5b3997af6c26e9a8c17f4ab790aa1e11.

This is a counterexample to the proposed supplier under these structural
restrictions. It is a NONCOVER, so it neither refutes Erdős #7 nor rules out
a supplier using additional consequences specific to whole coverage.

### 13.1. Complete divisor inventory and the actual outside domain

Use the same retained set D from section12.1 and Q=46189. The new full
numerical inventory is exactly

    {db : d in D union{1}, b divides Q} minus{1}.       (IC1)

Unique prime factorization separates the factors because every d is
{3,5,7}-smooth and Q=11*13*17*19. Hence all products are distinct and
there are29*16-1=463 numerical moduli. The displayed D is closed under
nonunit divisors. A divisor of db decomposes as d'b' with d' dividing d
and b' dividing b, so IC1 is also closed under nonunit divisors. The
literal input is additionally checked directly for every divisor.

The fifteen outside-only originals are0 modulo11,13,17,19 and

    (143,1),(187,1),(209,1),(221,1),(247,1),(323,1),
    (2431,2),(2717,2),(3553,3),(4199,2),(46189,4).      (IC2)

Define V as the set of y modulo Q avoiding ALL fifteen classes in IC2,
including the four prime classes. Its exact cardinality is33458. The
retained and full periods are

    L_B=10418625,   L=L_B Q=481225870125.

The new family retains the original452 numerical moduli and adds the
eleven composite outside-only moduli. Its retained phases are different;
no preservation of the old covered union is claimed.

### 13.2. Private integers prove irredundancy against the complete union

For every numerical original (m_i,a_i), its supplied private integer w_i
satisfies

    w_i mod m_i=a_i,
    w_i mod m_j!=a_j for every j!=i.                 (IC3)

These are direct integer comparisons against all463 originals, giving
214369 incidence checks. Deleting class i therefore changes the covered
subset at w_i. Every class is necessary for this family's union, not just
free of containment in one other class. Any proper subfamily has a
strictly smaller covered union. In particular, the union-preserving
reduction from section12.4 deletes nothing here.

The supplied integer

    h=170272916129                                  (IC4)

misses every original class. This is a direct noncoverage certificate
independent of the phase-excess argument. All463 private integers and h
lie in the single full period; none is chosen separately for a different
law or a different projected model.

### 13.3. Exact pointwise bounds exclude every outside law

For each original m_i=d_i b_i, recover the retained phase a_i modulo d_i
and outside phase a_i modulo b_i from its FULL numerical residue. For
every y in V form

    P_d(y)={a_i mod d : d_i=d, y mod b_i=a_i mod b_i},
    R_d(y)=|P_d(y)|.

The pure original at modulus d ensures R_d(y)>=1. Equal phases merge as a
set, even when they arise from different original labels. Define exactly
the same quantities as in PE2/PE3:

    F_S(y)=sum_(d in D) omega_B(d)(R_d(y)-1),
    F_H(y)=sum_(d in D) (R_d(y)-1)/d.

Every L_B omega_B(d) and L_B/d is an integer. Direct reconstruction on
ALL33458 outside survivors gives

    min_V F_S=256/735=1/3+11/735,
    argmin_V F_S={19802},
    min_V F_H=29222/212625=5/48+113177/3402000,
    argmin_V F_H={25022}.                           (IC5)

The [solver-free verifier](../../../frontier/cover-geometry/merged-phase-excess/irredundant_divisor_closed_phase_obstruction.py)
uses integer masks for sets of actual retained phases and integer sums
for both scores. Its [exact output](../../../frontier/cover-geometry/merged-phase-excess/irredundant_divisor_closed_phase_obstruction.json)
records the complete-domain minima, all minimizing points, private-point
and containment checks, and input hash. The SHA256 of the ordered list
of all (y,L_B F_S(y),L_B F_H(y)) triples is

    af0026663acb22f2ff6214eed2e2feeb6722e123019d1c8e0a93e8b747219f6c.

For ANY probability eta supported on V, integrating the two pointwise
inequalities in IC5 gives

    integral F_S d eta>=256/735>1/3,
    integral F_H d eta>=29222/212625>5/48.           (IC6)

This includes all nonproduct laws and point masses. The two minimizers
need not coincide: each lower bound separately holds at EVERY allowed
point, so both inequalities hold for the SAME eta. Neither low-excess
strict reverse is available for this family under any outside law.

### 13.4. What phase counts retain, and what this obstruction excludes

A useful sufficient rule for preserving row counts is the following.
Hold all numerical moduli and outside cylinders fixed. At each retained
d, preserve equality and inequality of retained phases for every pair of
labels whose outside cylinders meet. For a fixed y, all active labels are
pairwise outside-compatible. Their equality partition is therefore
unchanged, and its number of blocks R_d(y) is unchanged. This proves the
rule pointwise without choosing any probability measure.

The rule imposes only within-d equality data. It does not assert that
cross-modulus retained intersections, private integers, or the whole
covered union are preserved. For this input, an independent direct-set
calculation checked all33458*28=936824 row counts against the original452
family restricted to the new V: they agree. Adding IC2's eleven classes
only restricts the outside domain and keeps both minimizers in IC5.
The standalone verifier derives IC5 directly from the new463 full
originals, so the obstruction does not depend on a recoloring algorithm
or on this comparison with the old family.

Irredundancy, numerical divisor closure, and normalized prime classes
therefore do not imply a supported law with either strict PE2/PE3 reverse.
The private points concern this fixed family's union; they do not assert
global extremality among hypothetical whole covers. A proof of #7 using
this route must use stronger whole-cover information, or retain further
joint phase geometry in a different contradiction. The original whole-
cover implications PE2/PE3 and conditional suppliers remain valid.

These are ordinary arithmetic certificates and a finite-domain argument,
not Lean verification. Independent checking reconstructed the phases
without producer helpers and separately verified all private integers,
the hole, and12415 nonunit-divisor memberships. The canonical verifier
reads only its explicit input and writes only its explicit output; its
mathematical checks remain active with Python optimization.

```sh
python3 -I -S -B -O docs/reports/erdos7-odd-covering/frontier/cover-geometry/merged-phase-excess/irredundant_divisor_closed_phase_obstruction.py --input docs/reports/erdos7-odd-covering/frontier/cover-geometry/merged-phase-excess/irredundant_divisor_closed_phase_obstruction_originals.json --output docs/reports/erdos7-odd-covering/frontier/cover-geometry/merged-phase-excess/irredundant_divisor_closed_phase_obstruction.json
```

### 13.5. Arbitrary prime tails and arbitrarily small positive uncovered density

The obstruction is not limited to seven support primes or bounded outside
heights. Let T be any finite set of primes greater than19, and choose
any positive integer H_p for each p in T. Add the original classes

    c_(p,e)=(p^(e-1)-1)/(p-1) modulo p^e,
    1<=e<=H_p,   p in T.                            (IC7)

These are the residues0,1,1+p,... at successive powers. For e<f,

    c_(p,f)-c_(p,e)=p^(e-1)(1+p+...+p^(f-e-1)),

whose p-adic valuation is exactly e-1. Thus the two classes are disjoint.
The same calculation with f=H_p+1 shows that the coordinate
c_(p,H_p+1) avoids every added p-power class. Let S_p be their nonempty
complement modulo p^H_p.

All original moduli remain distinct, odd and greater than one. Divisors
of an old modulus are still old, and every nonunit divisor of an added
p^e is an added p^j. The numerical inventory remains divisor-closed.
The added pure prime class is0 modulo p, preserving prime normalization.

CRT extends an old private integer w_i by choosing an S_p-coordinate at
every new prime. The resulting integer belongs only to the old class i.
For a new class at p^e, choose the old full coordinate h from IC4, choose
its own p-coordinate c_(p,e), and choose S_q-coordinates at every other
new prime q. Pairwise disjointness of IC7 excludes the other p-power
classes, and the old hole excludes all old classes. This is a private
integer for the new original. Combining h with S_p-coordinates everywhere
also gives an uncovered integer. Hence genuine union-irredundancy and
noncoverage persist for every finite T and every choice of heights.

Relative to B={3,5,7}, every new class is outside-only. The new actual
outside survivor is exactly

    V_T=V times product_(p in T) S_p.

Every mixed original from section13.1 has the same activity and retained
phase at (y,(z_p)) as at y; there are no new mixed originals. Therefore
F_S and F_H pull back from the original V, pointwise. Their exact minima
in IC5 and the all-law obstruction IC6 remain unchanged, including for
laws correlating old and new coordinates. Taking T to be all primes
from23 through any chosen terminal prime gives arbitrarily long initial
segments of the odd primes as the exact support; the H_p have no bound.

There is also no repair using any fixed near-coverage density threshold.
Let delta_0 be the positive uncovered density of the original463 family.
Periodicity defines this density exactly and IC4 gives delta_0>=1/L.
Under uniform counting on the new full CRT carrier the uncovered set is
the old uncovered set times all S_p, so its density is exactly

    delta_T=delta_0 product_(p in T)
                [1-sum_(e=1..H_p) p^(-e)]>0.        (IC8)

The local factor is positive because the finite geometric sum is less
than1/(p-1), and is at most1-1/p. Take T to contain all primes from23
through a bound P>=23. Every odd prime at most P now has its original
class0 modulo p, so, writing H_n=sum_(j=1..n)1/j,

    delta_T<=product_(3<=p<=P)(1-1/p)
            =2 product_(p<=P)(1-1/p)<=2/H_floor(P).

The last inequality follows by expanding the inverse finite Euler
product: it contains every term1/j with j<=floor(P). Thus for EVERY
epsilon>0 there is a finite irredundant family with distinct odd nonunit
moduli, a divisor-closed inventory, normalized prime classes, and IC6,
whose uncovered density satisfies

    0<delta_T<epsilon.                              (IC9)

An explicit choice is k=max(5,ceil(4/epsilon)), P=2^k: dyadic grouping
gives H_(2^k)>=1+k/2, hence delta_T<=4/(k+2)<epsilon.
This includes any prescribed lower bound on all newly added heights:
larger H_p only decrease the local surviving factors. The uncovered
density is always positive for each finite member. A limit with density
zero is neither a finite covering system nor an assertion that every
integer is covered. IC9 rules out replacing whole coverage by a fixed
arbitrarily high density premise in the proposed supplier; it does not
rule out consequences of exact whole coverage, justified extremality
among whole covers, or a threshold depending on the particular support
and period. The extension and limit statements follow from the
displayed CRT and product proofs, not from finite enumeration.

### 13.6. Every centered two-parent contraction is blocked in the same family

The same463-class family defeats a further proposed repair: selecting
two original children above the same prime, moving their two original
parents to the compatible child cofactor classes, and deleting the
children. This holds for all original child heights and for prime as
well as composite parents. It persists under every extension in13.5.

The two successful joint reductions in
[385, sections6--8](../350-399/385-private-congruence-hulls-and-crossed-modulus-closure.md#6-a-mixed-root-cross-permits-a-joint-composite-parent-contraction)
show that this operation can reduce an irredundant divisor-closed odd
family. The result here checks its complete specified domain on the
actual463 family, rather than only looking for those two sufficient
patterns. It is an obstruction to this repair class, not a claim that
the463 family is globally extremal or a whole cover.

#### The operation and a literal obstruction

Fix a support prime P and two original child labels

    d=P^e m,  f=P^h n,
    e,h>=1,  m,n>1,  P not dividing mn,  m!=n.       (CP1)

Divisor closure makes m,n original labels. Define their actual child
cofactor residues c=a_d mod m and b=a_f mod n. Require that they can
refer to one common cofactor point:

    c=b modulo gcd(m,n).                            (CP2)

The operation moves A_m to c mod m and A_n to b mod n, removes A_d
and A_f, and keeps every other original class unchanged. It uses461
classes, with the two parents' original numerical labels. No equality
or inequality of the children's first P-roots is imposed. We also do
not require the common cofactor to avoid every P-free original: checking
all CP2 candidates includes those that satisfy this additional source
condition. Both children are contained in their new parents.

If w is an original private integer for parent m and

    w != b modulo n,                                (CP3)

then w becomes uncovered. Indeed no unchanged original covers w, and
the new m-class cannot cover it: comparable-original disjointness gives
c!=a_m mod m. CP3 excludes the other new parent. The analogous test
with the two parents reversed is equally valid. Thus a legal operation
must rescue EVERY private integer of each old parent using the other
new parent. Rescuing one selected witness is insufficient.

The [eight additional private integers](../../../frontier/cover-geometry/merged-phase-excess/centered_pair_contraction_blockers.json),
together with the463 witnesses already in the original input, rule out
every CP1--CP2 candidate. These additional points are:

| Original private owner | Integer |
| ---: | ---: |
| 3 | 38225498559 |
| 5 | 154233623140 |
| 7 | 409475178392 |
| 9 | 23803106923 |
| 21 | 435127539118 |
| 33 | 409205747369 |
| 39 | 291456798179 |
| 135 | 449637875486 |

The [standalone verifier](../../../frontier/cover-geometry/merged-phase-excess/centered_pair_contraction_obstruction.py)
checks every one of these471 integers directly against all463 originals,
reconstructs all child decompositions from the original numerical labels,
and enumerates all pairs of different parents for each P. Its
[exact output](../../../frontier/cover-geometry/merged-phase-excess/centered_pair_contraction_obstruction.json)
gives:

| Pair scope | All nonunit parents | Both parents composite |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Same-prime child pairs with different parents | 199127 | 179031 |
| Compatible cofactor centers | 46201 | 34870 |
| Excluded by an original chosen private witness | 46188 | 34864 |
| Further excluded by the eight extra points | 13 | 6 |
| Compatible pairs not excluded | 0 | 0 |

The pair counts retain original child labels and heights; two child
assignments with the same resulting center pair remain separate rows.
The152926 incompatible pairs in the first column are outside CP2.
Their coverage-preservation behavior is not asserted here.

For the13 cases that pass both original chosen-witness tests, the
verifier also constructs the entire changed461-class family and checks
that the supplied lost integer has no new covering class. For example,
at P=11, children99 and165 have parents9 and15 and centers4 modulo
both parents. Their original chosen witnesses are rescued, but23803106923
is private to9 and is not4 modulo15, so the full replacement loses it.
This demonstrates why one witness per parent does not suffice for the
rejection certificate, even though a single LOST witness suffices to
refute an individual operation.

The canonical input is unchanged, with SHA256
427138d17d61f284dff84c2143b90b3b5b3997af6c26e9a8c17f4ab790aa1e11.
The verifier reads only its three explicit paths, uses no stored pair
list or solver, and keeps all checks active under optimization. Normal
and optimized runs give identical output bytes; an independent raw-input
enumeration agrees on all199127 pair assignments and all rejection counts.

```sh

```

#### Pure-prime tails preserve the complete obstruction

In13.5 every added label is a pure new-prime power l^j. If it were an
eligible child P^e m with P not dividing m, then P=l and e=j, forcing
m=1, which CP1 excludes. A new pure-prime label also cannot be a
cofactor parent of an old child, since its prime divides no old modulus.
Consequently the ENTIRE list of eligible(P,parent,child) triples and
their compatible pairs remains exactly the old list.

CRT extends every old blocking private integer w to an integer equal
to w modulo the old full period and equal to c_(l,H_l+1) modulo
l^H_l for every new prime. As proved in13.5, this avoids every new
class. It preserves w's unique old owner and its failure to lie in
either new parent class of the associated operation. Every candidate
therefore still loses an actual private integer in the extended family.

It follows that IC9's arbitrarily near-covering irredundant families
can ALSO exclude every operation CP1--CP2, with arbitrary new prime
heights and arbitrarily many initial odd support primes. Their two
low-phase-excess obstructions remain unchanged. Thus adding resistance
to these two-parent contractions does not supply either low-excess law,
even at an arbitrarily high fixed density below one.

The two-parent result alone leaves larger batches outside its scope;
section13.7 below excludes every size at one fixed prime. Incompatible
new centers, different child primes, other edits and consequences of
exact whole coverage remain outside both results. In particular it does not prove
minimality under all covered-union-preserving changes. The finite
certificate and the tail-extension proof are ordinary mathematics,
not new Lean verification or a resolution of unrestricted Erdős#7.

### 13.7. Every size of same-prime centered parent relocation is blocked

The two-parent obstruction extends to a complete class of simultaneous
relocations, with no bound on the number of selected parents. In the
same463 family, fix ANY one support prime P. Select any nonempty set
of distinct P-free original parents m>1, and for each select a center

    c_m=a_d mod m,  d=P^e m an actual original, e>=1.

Require that all selected centers have one common CRT realization:

    c_m=c_n modulo gcd(m,n) for every selected m,n.    (CB1)

Replacing each selected A_m by c_m mod m necessarily loses an integer
that was private to one of the selected original parents. This remains
true even when ALL children and every other original are retained.
Deleting children afterwards cannot repair the loss. Thus the result
excludes every size of CP1--CP2 contraction at once, including all
original heights, prime parents, and composite parents.

The proof uses finite necessary-condition propagation on all actual
relocation options. It does not enumerate parent subsets of sizes
three, four, and so on. The result is about this family and the
extensions below, not about every irredundant odd family. The successful
joint contractions in385 remain valid.

#### A private-witness rule excludes whole classes of subsets

For a fixed P, an option i is a pair (m_i,c_i) arising from one or more
actual children P^e m_i. Children giving the same pair are recorded
under that one option. This identifies identical proposed parent
classes, not original numerical labels: all child labels and heights
are reconstructed from the original input. Let V be the full finite
option set. Different options at the same parent cannot both be chosen.
For i in V, put

    C(i)={i} union {j: m_j!=m_i,
                      c_j=c_i mod gcd(m_j,m_i)}.

For each verified original private integer w of m_i, put

    R(i,w)={j in C(i) minus {i}: w=c_j mod m_j}.       (CB2)

Every covered-union-preserving selected set S must satisfy

    i in S implies S subset C(i),
    i in S implies S intersect R(i,w) nonempty
                    for EVERY checked w of m_i.      (CB3)

Indeed, no unchanged original contains w. The new i-class also misses
w: irredundancy and m_i|P^e m_i give c_i!=a_(m_i). Thus some other
selected new parent must cover w; that parent has a different label
and a center compatible with i. This is only a necessary condition:
rescuing these points would not certify the other private points or
joint liabilities. Failure, however, supplies a literal lost integer.
The rescue-cycle necessity in356 section5 is an earlier instance of
this principle; CB3 retains a separate obligation for EVERY supplied
private witness.

Start with any live set U containing all options of a possible S.
If i in U has a witness w with R(i,w) intersect U empty, delete i.
No member of S is deleted, by CB3. Repeating simultaneous deletion
rounds therefore preserves S inside every live set. An empty result
rules out every nonempty S, regardless of its cardinality.

A second sound rule uses a provisional selected option i. Any S
containing i lies inside U intersect C(i). Apply the same deletion
rule in that smaller universe. If i itself disappears, no feasible S
can contain it, so i may also be deleted from the global U. Several
such conclusions derived from the same old U may be applied together;
ordinary deletion then continues. This is a finite implication proof,
not an assertion that pairwise compatibility or nonempty residuals
would be sufficient for a valid exchange.

#### Exact exhaustion using the original numerical classes

The [additional private integers](../../../frontier/cover-geometry/merged-phase-excess/centered_batch_relocation_blockers.json)
contain395 points, in addition to the463 private witnesses in the
unchanged original input. The
[standalone verifier](../../../frontier/cover-geometry/merged-phase-excess/centered_batch_relocation_obstruction.py)
validates all858 against all463 originals:397254 literal membership
checks. It reconstructs every eligible child, every option, every
compatibility relation and every witness-rescue relation. Its
[exact output](../../../frontier/cover-geometry/merged-phase-excess/centered_batch_relocation_obstruction.json)
records:

| P | Original eligible children | Distinct parent-center options | Ordinary deletion layers | Remaining |
|---:|---:|---:|---|---:|
| 3 | 299 | 298 | 71,78,68,22,58,1 | 0 |
| 5 | 237 | 233 | 46,70,17,15,16,7,18,41,3 | 0 |
| 7 | 205 | 203 | 34,47,4 | 118 |
| 11 | 231 | 231 | 74,128,27,2 | 0 |
| 13 | 231 | 231 | 102,74,23,9,8,2,13 | 0 |
| 17 | 231 | 231 | 108,88,32,3 | 0 |
| 19 | 231 | 231 | 113,30,72,15,1 | 0 |

At P=7, condition separately on each of the118 remaining options.
For115 of them, deletion inside its compatible universe eliminates
the provisional selected option. Delete those115 globally; the
remaining three then fail the ordinary witness rule in one round.
The final live set is empty for every P. In total1658 distinct options
are excluded, with5908 individual deletion checks including the
conditional tests. These totals refer to the displayed395-point input
and deterministic witness order, not to a search for optimal witnesses.

The finite computation is a certificate of the CB3 contradiction.
It never enumerates the full481225870125-point carrier, assumes an
unobserved private integer, or trusts a solver's unsatisfiability status.
The common center is not required to avoid the P-free originals, so
CB1's checked domain also contains all choices satisfying that stronger
actual-source condition. The entire input remains a noncover, with
its original explicit hole170272916129.

The canonical original SHA256 remains
427138d17d61f284dff84c2143b90b3b5b3997af6c26e9a8c17f4ab790aa1e11.
Only the three explicit paths are accessed. Checks remain active under

#### Arbitrarily small positive hole density retains the all-size obstruction

In every13.5 extension, all new originals are pure powers of new
primes. Such a child has cofactor1 and contributes no option; no old
child acquires a new cofactor parent. Thus all same-prime option sets
are exactly the old ones, and new primes have empty option sets.

Extend each of the858 private integers by CRT, retaining its old
residue and taking the explicit avoiding residue c_(l,H_l+1) modulo
l^H_l at each new prime, as in13.5. Every extended point still has its
unique old owner and misses every new class. All congruences used in
CB1--CB3 involve only old parent moduli, so their truth values remain
unchanged. The same finite implication proof therefore excludes every
nonempty relocation batch in every extension.

Consequently, for every epsilon>0, there is a finite divisor-closed,
irredundant, odd-distinct family with normalized prime classes, both
IC6 low-excess obstructions, uncovered density strictly between0 and
epsilon, AND resistance to all the same-prime centered parent
relocations just defined. Arbitrarily many initial support primes and
arbitrarily high added pure-prime prefixes are allowed. Exact whole
coverage cannot be replaced by an arbitrarily high fixed density and
this entire relocation-resistance condition in the proposed supplier.

Section13.8 also excludes different child primes in one batch under
the common-center condition. Incompatible new centers, centers not
induced by actual children, and other changes remain outside these
results. In particular they do not prove global minimality of the463
family or exclude exchanges that also alter other originals.
The argument and finite certificate are ordinary mathematics, not new
Lean verification or a resolution of unrestricted Erdős#7.

### 13.8. Mixed child primes also forbid every common-center relocation batch

For the same463 original classes, the prime used to induce a new parent
phase may vary between selected parents. Every nonempty batch in this
larger class still loses an originally covered integer. The conclusion
requires one common CRT center but no bound on batch size. Unlike13.7,
the proof needs points with several old owners; it does not claim that
every loss is witnessed by an original private point.

For each actual original child d and each prime p dividing d, write

    d=p^e m,  e=v_p(d)>=1,  p not dividing m,  m>1.

The original parent m exists by divisor closure. The resulting option
is (m,c), with c=a_d modulo m. Options with the same(m,c) are identical
proposed parent classes, so they may be grouped, retaining all original
child labels, primes and heights as provenance. Comparable-original
disjointness gives c!=a_m. Reconstructing the full input gives1603
options at449 eligible original parents, with1665 child-prime-height
records. The grouped option count is smaller than13.7's sum across
separate primes because an identical(m,c) can arise at different primes.

A selected set A is nonempty, uses at most one option per parent, and
satisfies

    c_i=c_j modulo gcd(m_i,m_j) for every i,j in A.    (CM1)

The finite generalized CRT makes CM1 equivalent to existence of one
integer realizing all selected centers. To see sufficiency, choose,
at each prime, a selected modulus of maximum exponent. Pairwise
compatibility makes its phase agree with every lower exponent at that
prime; ordinary CRT then joins the prime-power coordinates.

Change precisely the selected original parents to their proposed
phases, retaining every other original. A child used to induce one
option may itself be another selected parent, so the mixed-prime
operation must not be described as leaving every child untouched.
The stated operation is nevertheless the largest resulting union if
one also wishes to delete any original classes afterwards. Such
deletions cannot restore an integer already lost by the replacement.

#### Shared old owners give necessary implications

Let P(A) be the selected parent labels. For any originally covered
integer w define, using the full numerical originals and options,

    O(w)={m: w=a_m modulo m},
    R(w)={i: w=c_i modulo m_i}.

If some old owner is not selected, its unchanged original still covers
w. If all old owners are selected, only a proposed new class can
rescue w. Consequently preservation at this point is EXACTLY

    O(w) subset P(A)  implies  A intersect R(w) is nonempty.  (CM2)

This is a same-integer implication: it does not combine independently
chosen private witnesses or laws into a fictitious common source.
For singleton O(w), CM2 is the private-witness condition used earlier.

The private conditions alone are insufficient even for the checked
input. The five proposed parent phases

    (5,2), (7,2), (17,11), (143,119), (171,92)

are induced by actual children, share the center445479489002, and
preserve all858 supplied private integers. But481093572625 has old
owner set{5,171} and belongs to no class after this replacement. Thus
passing all those private tests is not a coverage-preserving exchange.
This statement concerns the858 supplied private integers, not an
enumeration of every actual private integer in the full period.

In addition to the existing private input, the following ten points
suffice for the exclusion. Each listed owner set is checked against
all463 numerical originals; each rescue set is reconstructed against
all1603 numerical option classes.

| Integer w | Exact original owners O(w) | Number of proposed rescuers |
| ---: | --- | ---: |
| 412070210125 | 5,7,17 | 8 |
| 81127832500 | 5,9,11,13 | 3 |
| 168172364921 | 11 | 16 |
| 132084398875 | 5,11,13 | 6 |
| 250668554125 | 5,11 | 8 |
| 254458847500 | 5,11,13,17 | 6 |
| 30923151625 | 5,9 | 9 |
| 468401215375 | 5,9 | 7 |
| 299488721625 | 3,5,17 | 4 |
| 282188731500 | 3,5,13,19 | 3 |

The singleton row is retained alongside the genuinely joint rows.
These are necessary point constraints, not an assertion that the ten
points characterize the entire covered union.

#### A finite exhaustive implication proof

The [standalone verifier](../../../frontier/cover-geometry/merged-phase-excess/centered_mixed_relocation_obstruction.py)
reads the unchanged originals, the395 extra private integers from13.7,
and the [ten-point input](../../../frontier/cover-geometry/merged-phase-excess/centered_mixed_relocation_blockers.json).
It rebuilds the options and all incidences, then checks that no nonempty
selection can satisfy CM1 and every supplied CM2. The
[exact result](../../../frontier/cover-geometry/merged-phase-excess/centered_mixed_relocation_obstruction.json)
is produced by finite case analysis without a SAT or SMT solver.

Here is the invariant making the computation a proof. A search state
(U,S,F) retains every hypothetical completion A with

    S subset A subset U,  F subset P(A),

where U is the live option set, S the required options and F the
required parent labels. Selected options remove their incompatible
neighbors. A required parent must have a live option. Conditional on
selecting i, all remaining options must lie in U intersect C(i);
here C(i) consists of i and its CRT-compatible options at different
parent labels, across all inducing primes. In this restricted universe,
every private obligation of its parent, every already required parent,
and every now fully required joint-owner row must still be satisfiable
there. A failure excludes i. These tests only remove impossible
completions of the displayed invariant.

When all owners of a point are required, at least one live rescuer is
required. A unique rescuer forces that option; rescuers all at the same
parent force that parent. If there is no live rescuer and exactly one
old owner is not yet required, that last owner must remain unchanged.
Removing its options is therefore sound. Empty required choices are
contradictions. Every nonterminal propagation round shrinks U or grows
S or F.

At stability, the remaining cases are exhaustive: choose each possible
center of a required parent; split an undecided parent into moved and
unmoved; or choose each possible rescuer of an unmet requirement.
If no option is yet selected and no such requirement exists, branch
on each live option using nonemptiness of A. Rescuer branches may
overlap, which is harmless when every branch is contradictory.
An actual satisfying necessary-condition selection causes rejection
of the exclusion claim; it is never treated as a proof of preservation.

All49126 nodes close, with35618 contradiction leaves and no surviving
necessary-condition model. The largest branch depth is14; the node
and depth figures measure this deterministic implication proof, not a
bound on the permitted number of relocated parents. Since preserving
the old union would satisfy these necessary conditions, no operation
CM1 preserves that union. The
verifier also checks the five-parent control directly, including its
lost integer. Inputs are explicit paths and arithmetic checks use
exceptions, so Python optimization does not disable them.

#### The same obstruction persists along all prescribed pure-prime tails

In13.5 an added original is a pure power of a new prime. Removing its
full prime power leaves parent1, which is ineligible. No added parent
divides an old child. Thus the complete mixed-prime option set is
unchanged, not merely the option sets at individual old primes.

For every checked old point w, CRT chooses an extension equal to w
modulo the old full period and equal to c_(l,H_l+1) modulo l^H_l at
each new prime l. That explicit residue avoids all added classes by
13.5. The entire old owner set O(w), including joint owner sets, is
therefore unchanged. So is R(w), since every option has an old parent
modulus. The same finite contradiction applies to every extension.

Consequently the arbitrarily small positive hole densities of IC9
can coexist with resistance to ALL mixed-prime common-center batches
defined here, divisor closure, genuine irredundancy, normalized prime
classes, and both pointwise low-excess obstructions IC6. This rules
out another proposed sufficient replacement for exact whole coverage.
It does not exclude incompatible centers, arbitrary new phases, edits
outside the stated parent options, or a consequence specific to an
actual whole cover. The input remains an explicitly certified noncover;
the unrestricted Erdős#7 question and the whole-cover bridge remain
unresolved. These are ordinary arithmetic and finite-case proofs,
not new Lean verification.
