# A common joint source admits all late-four high mixed supports

Let P={3,5,7,11,13,17,19}, Q=P minus{3}, and L={11,13,17,19}. Take any finite actual family with pairwise distinct odd nonunit P-smooth numerical moduli, arbitrary fixed residues and arbitrary finite heights. Allow every pure prime power, every rooted star3^a p^b, every rooted triangle3^a p^b q^c, every non3 pair tower in

    E9={(5,7),(5,11),(7,17),(7,19),(11,17),(11,19),
        (13,17),(13,19),(17,19)},

and every non3 support S contained in L with |S|>=3. The last clause permits all four triple towers and the full quadruple tower, with every positive exponent vector.

There is one probability rho on its complete actual survivor U with

    R_P(rho)<=224167587171895144296993552278596972445671925

             =11.549928354137863... <566/49.             (HG1)

Arbitrary further distinct originals touching23 or29, with arbitrary P-smooth cofactors, phases and finite heights, still leave actual Haar survivor mass at least

    346188371998272899824226991774152611457147

      =0.0000006893847683613951... >1/1500000.          (HG2)

This enlarges Report570's support class; its stronger earlier numerical constants remain valid on that smaller class. The theorem neither requires root-prefix freedom nor selects projected phases. It does not include arbitrary rooted supports of size>=4 or the missing non3 pair towers. It is ordinary mathematics and exact rational computation using existing comparison and kernel constructions, not new Lean verification or a claim of external novelty.

## 1. One actual normalized source

Use the complete actual pure-p survivor as each coordinate base. Its normalized law gives cylinder caps (p-1)/[(p-2)p^e]. Assign every actual mixed original to its largest prime q and form its actual forbidden union A_q at each complete previous history. Apply Report561 AR3's normalized distortion kernel with

    (t5,t7,t11,t13,t17,t19)=(0,1,3,4,5,7),
    delta_q=t_q/(q-2).

This gives one normalized joint law mu, including the histories with entirely forbidden fibres. Its full-past cylinder caps and global Haar density bound are

    (C3,C5,C7,C11,C13,C17,C19)
       =(2,4/3,3/2,5/3,12/7,8/5,9/5),
    mu([r]_(q^e)|past)<=Cq/q^e,
    dmu/dH<=Lambda=product Cp=1152/35.                (HG3)

Every later normalized row preserves the probabilities of previously assigned events. The actual phase of every original remains fixed; no auxiliary height law is substituted for the actual source.

Write independent comparison heights Kp with Pr(Kp>=j)=Cp/p^j, j>=1, and gp=EKp=Cp/(p-1). The exact cofactor inventories for rows5,7,11,13 are Report570 PG1. Row17 adds one product K11*K13 to that inventory, corresponding to the new support{11,13,17}. Row19 adds

    K11*K13+K11*K17+K13*K17+K11*K13*K17.

Thus explicitly

 M17=K3(1+K5+K7+K11+K13)+K7+K11+K13+K11*K13,

 M19=K3(1+K5+K7+K11+K13+K17)+K7+K11+K13+K17
       +K11*K13+K11*K17+K13*K17+K11*K13*K17.        (HG4)

For every fixed current q-exponent, numerical uniqueness gives at most one original per full old cofactor. The different support monomials enumerate disjoint numerical label patterns. Apply conditional convex comparison to the actual labelled cylinders under the same previous marginal, before completing to these inventories. The existing normalized-kernel argument then yields

    mu(Aq)<=bq=E(Mq-tq)_+/(q-2-tq),
    s=mu(U)>=1-sum_q bq.                            (HG5)

The original events need not be independent, and the actual final mu differs from the old source because its17 and19 forbidden unions include the new supports. Bounds are not added across different optimizing laws.

## 2. Exact low events retain every height

For any nonnegative integer-valued M,

    E(M-t)_+=EM-t+sum_(m<t)(t-m)Pr(M=m).             (HG6)

The means in HG4 are evaluated by independence of the auxiliary heights, replacing each Kp monomial by the corresponding product of gp. This retains the entire high tail. At K3=0, K5 integrates to one in rows17 and19 and every other active variable has a positive linear coefficient. At K3=k>0, every previous Q coordinate has a positive linear coefficient. Therefore the events M<t involve finitely many values of every active coordinate, even with the new interaction terms. Exact finite enumeration of these low events together with the full mean computes HG6 without truncating a positive tail.

The charges are

    b5=1/3,
    b7=41/180,
    b11=920489/11907000,
    b13=50909297/1375258500,
    b17=47451950714518818239/1248839143114168856250,
    b19=380494401503206437545347690294799713
          /15004063730351506037395086038432812500.

Consequently

    s>=s0=7838365711219648132666311015826216699
             /30008127460703012074790172076865625000
          =0.26120809175728604... .                  (HG7)

The full query includes every nonunit P-smooth modulus, not only the original support inventory. Its auxiliary load with the unit included is V=product_p(1+Kp). The same full-mean and exact low-product calculation gives

    B=E(V-6)_+
      =110858473194725664986233638097168
         /64795630020766937106234185390625
      =1.7108942865312928... .                        (HG8)

## 3. Complete queries and actual continuation

Set sigma=mu restricted to U, of mass s. For each finite query box choose all phases maximizing under this same sigma, and include the unit in L. The pointwise inequality L-1<=5+(L-6)_+ and the same-source conditional comparison give

    R_P(sigma)<=5s+B.

Cofinal exhaustion gives the full all-height result because every term is nonnegative and the auxiliary first moment is finite. This uses the conditional caps of mu before deletion; it does not carry them through final conditioning. Dividing by s proves HG1. Before normalization the strict margin is

    566s-49R_P(sigma)>=321s0-49B
      =346188371998272899824226991774152611457147
         /24767698132439755831791956763118299065625000
      =0.013977414055480957... >0.                    (HG9)

Independently condition23 and29 Haar on their actual complete pure-power survivors. Their positive-height query sums are at most1/21 and1/27, and their density product is at most616/567. Arbitrary mixed additional labels have total charge at most

    R_P(sigma)/21+R_P(sigma)/27+[R_P(sigma)+s]/567.

The old unit contributes the actual mass s in the final term. The remaining submeasure has mass at least HG9/567, and density at most Lambda*616/567. Dividing gives HG2. This continuation asserts survival/Haar mass, not the preservation of the seven-prime query bound by the newly conditioned nine-prime law.

## 4. The integrated supports improve on a later union charge

Keep exactly the final caps HG3 but construct only the old E9 plus rooted triangle source. Its old survivor reserve is

    s_base=1138658364206362881832578372012329707
              /4286875351529001724970024582409375000.

The cap sum for all five new support towers is

    sum_(S subset L,|S|>=3) product_(p in S)gp=17/2100.

Deleting them afterward by this cap sum, using the same B, gives only

    5+B/(s_base-17/2100)=11.643739975212638...,

which exceeds566/49. Integrating them into their actual normalized17 and19 rows gives HG1 instead. Thus the retained extension is not justified by simply charging the new towers against the old scalar reserve. This compares sufficient estimates and does not exclude other old certificates for particular instances.

For a narrower subclass omitting{11,13,17}, the original Report570 schedule with t19=6 already gives11.547534092653025..., with nine-prime Haar lower bound>1/500000. For ALL five supports that same fixed schedule gives11.589961619419185..., which fails its sufficient gate. The final theorem changes only t19 to7; no maximal-support or optimal-schedule claim is made.

## 5. Relation to the existing terrain

Report561 covers arbitrary rooted supports but lacks these nonrooted high supports. Report563 permits all mixed supports on L under a root-prefix condition and excludes the E9 pairs involving5 or7; that condition is not assumed here. Report572 permits broad supports through a distinct shallow-selector/actual-fibre premise, which is not imposed or inferred here. The new class admits arbitrary root phases within its star/triangle supports and arbitrary phases/heights on all five added towers. The missing non3 pair{11,13}, other omitted pairs, and arbitrary rooted higher supports remain outside HG1.

Evidence: [late_hypergraph_joint_source.py](../../../frontier/cover-geometry/late-hypergraph-joint-source/late_hypergraph_joint_source.py) and [exact data](../../../frontier/cover-geometry/late-hypergraph-joint-source/late_hypergraph_joint_source.json). Running python3 -I -S -B -O passes47 named exact checks, including reproduction of Report570's baseline, the exact new charges, low probability/mean checks, the same-law continuation algebra, the two fixed comparison schedules, the failed a-posteriori cap certificate, and literal numerical cofactor inventory uniqueness. The general theorem follows from the ordinary derivation above; finite arithmetic does not establish its arbitrary-family quantifiers. No new Lean verification is claimed.

## 6. The missing11–13 tower exceeds the retained two-parameter estimate

Outcome: the current normalized-source certificate does NOT pass after adding the complete non3 pair tower{11,13} to Report576, even after optimizing the13-row threshold and the complete-query hinge threshold while fixing all other row thresholds. This is a failure of that specified certificate family, not a lower bound on actual supported laws and not an impossibility result for the desired support extension.

### Exact gap

Keep Report576's supports, all five later-four high supports, and add every numerical11^a13^b label with a,b>=1. Every phase stays arbitrary and globally fixed. This adds K11 to the13-row auxiliary cofactor count:

    M13=K3(1+K5+K7+K11)+K11.

At the old schedule(0,1,3,4,5,7), every cap is unchanged. The17 and19 inventories, their charges, and the full query hinge remain unchanged; the13-row charge alone increases by

    Delta b13=6290747/813541806=0.007732543003450765... .

The new scalar survivor reserve and query certificate are

    s0=7606326575176730270495070549024654199
          /30008127460703012074790172076865625000,
    B=110858473194725664986233638097168
         /64795630020766937106234185390625,
    5+B/s0=11.749740931393902... >566/49.

The raw target gate is

    321s0-49B
      =-61130862008692144789840832309162232590105353
          /24767698132439755831791956763118299065625000
      =-2.468168890052215... .

At fixed query numerator, a sufficient improvement in the survivor reserve would have to exceed

    61130862008692144789840832309162232590105353
      /7950431100513161622005218120960974000065625000
      =0.007688999657483535... .

Equivalently, at fixed reserve a query-hinge debit must exceed2.468168890052215/49. These are sufficient accounting requirements within this bound; the actual source can behave better than these upper estimates.

### Complete continuous threshold comparison

Fix the other row thresholds at t5=0,t7=1,t11=3,t17=5,t19=7. Vary t=t13 within the present comparison's admissible range

    0<=t<=131/13,
    C13=12/(11-t)<=13.

The limiting equality C13=13 is a valid height distribution with zero mass at height0; allowing only strict inequality does not alter the conclusion. Keep all actual normalized kernels and all original phases in one source at each fixed t.

This two-axis family can be settled without a real-parameter search. On each interval between successive integers, M13 is integer valued and its distribution is independent of t. Hence H13(t)=E(M13-t)_+ is affine in t. Its charge H13(t)/(11-t) is affine in y=1/(11-t).

For the later17 and19 charges, each auxiliary K13 atom is affine in C13, while every other coordinate law is fixed. Their integrable hinge expectations are therefore affine in C13 and in y. The complete query hinge E(V-tau)_+ is likewise affine in C13 for fixed tau. All earlier row charges are independent of t. Thus for any fixed complete-query threshold tau, the target gate

    G(t,tau)=[566-49(tau-1)]s0(t)-49E(V(t)-tau)_+

is affine in y on each integer t interval. Since V is integer valued, it is affine in tau on each integer tau interval as well. It suffices to test the cell corners.

The source reserves are positive and at most1 throughout: they are affine in y and have these properties at the endpoints. For tau<=1, V>=1 makes its query bound no better than tau=1. For tau>=13 the nonnegative hinge and566-49(tau-1)<=-22 make the target gate strictly negative. Therefore the useful corners are

    t in{0,1,...,10,131/13}, tau in{1,2,...,12}.

All144 exact corner gates are negative. Their largest is the original t13=4,tau=6 gate displayed above. The independent producer also checks an interior rational interpolation in every t interval for every such tau. The general interpolation argument, rather than those interior samples, proves the continuous conclusion.

Consequently changing only the13 threshold, even with an optimally chosen complete-query hinge threshold, cannot rescue this specific fixed-other-row certificate. This does not rule out changing another row, changing source order, using clipped-height comparisons beyond C13=13, or proving a new joint debit.

### One adjacent source reorder

There is a specific alternative order worth checking because it moves the newly added pair to a different actual kernel: process13 immediately before11, using order3,5,7,13,11,17,19, while retaining every coordinate's old threshold and cap. Assign each original to its last coordinate in this order. Its numerical labels and actual phases remain unchanged, and the same normalized-kernel proof applies.

The17 and19 inventories and complete query hinge remain exactly unchanged. The altered earlier charges are

    b13=8071793/291721500,
    b11=18799640579/183117753000.

They give only R<=11.97757776311741... and raw gate-5.12497800038873..., so this one concrete reorder is weaker than the original order. No search of all coordinate orders or other thresholds is claimed.

### Shared supports do not force positive overlap

Presence of all five high supports does not force a positive intersection with the new11--13 forbidden event. An actual irredundant six-label family gives a direct check. On coordinates11,13,17,19 use these original root constraints:

    pair11,13:          (0,0);
    triple11,13,17:     (1,1,1);
    triple11,13,19:     (1,2,1);
    triple11,17,19:     (1,2,2);
    triple13,17,19:     (1,2,1);
    quadruple:         (2,2,2,2).

Every numerical modulus is a distinct odd product of its listed primes. The pair event is disjoint from every high-support event, because each high event requires a nonzero11 or13 root. Completing each listed tuple with zero at its unlisted coordinate gives a private CRT point, so all six originals are essential. Over their literal common period46189 the pair has323 points and its intersection with the union of the five high events has zero points. This remains zero under every measure and every nonnegative hinge weighting.

Thus no uniformly positive repeat-union credit between the new pair event and the higher events follows from these supports alone. A useful overlap/debit theorem would require additional actual phase or query incidence information, or a distinct joint source construction. This small example does not claim that the corresponding family has a bad query law; it only excludes the automatic overlap premise.

The ordinary conditional comparison remains the supplier for arbitrary finite actual original heights and all query heights. No new universal comparison or actual-law lower bound has been proved. The unrestricted11--13 extension remains open, and no new Lean verification is claimed.
